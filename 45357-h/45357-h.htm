</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">In</span> Henslowe’s Diary, among the
curious items which Alleyn’s
fellow manager in the Fortune
and other theatres set down
concerning his transactions in
the plays of the time, the name
of a certain “Mr. Dickers,” will
be found under date 8th of January, 1597. In
this way, the adventure of Thomas Dekker into
the precarious field of dramatic authorship is
first recorded for us. The entry refers to some
twenty shillings “lent unto Thomas Dowton”
to buy a book of Dekker’s, no doubt the MS.
of some play written by him, the name of
which, however, is not given. A week later, a
second entry notes again a disbursement, this time
of four pounds, also for a book of his “called
Fayeton” (Phaeton), possibly a further part of the
same work. The third entry referring to him is
ominous: “Lent unto the companey, the 4 of
febreary 1598, to disecharge Mr. Dicker owt of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
cownter in the powltrey, the some of fortie shillings.
I saye dd to Thomas Dowton ... xxxx<sup>s</sup>.”
In the sorry indication of these three entries,
showing first the promising emergence of the young
playwright, and then immediately the coming of
disaster upon him, and his being lodged for debt
in “the Counter in the Poultry,” we have at once
the key to Dekker’s career. Dekker, perhaps the
most original and most striking figure among
the lesser known men of that brilliant array which
follows Marlowe, is at the same time one of the
most unfortunate in his life and its artistic outcome,
judged by the standard of his own genius.
It was as if Fortune, to take a figure from his own
play, having first presented him with the gift
which, as a poet of the time, he most desired,&mdash;the
playwright’s great opportunity, then turned upon
him, and said,&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="centerpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“But now go dwell with cares, and quickly die.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>If, however, he lived with cares, he laughed at
them, and he was too strong to let them kill him
outright. But, nevertheless, there they were;
they never perhaps quite upset that undaunted
good-humour of his, but they defeated him as an
artist, they allied themselves insidiously with his
own natural weaknesses to defeat the consummation
of a really great poetic faculty.</p>

<p>Dekker, however, is one of those authors whose
personal effect tends to outgo the purely artistic
one. He has the rare gift of putting heart into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
everything he says, and because of this abounding
heartiness of his, it is hard to measure him by the
absolute standards of criticism. Indeed, after
the endless shortcomings and disappointments
of his verse and prose have been estimated and
written against him, he remains, after all has been set
down, still the same lovable, elusive being, a man
of genius, a child of nature. For this reason, it
is disappointing that so little is to be actually
known of his life. As one reads his plays, and
marks the strong individuality shown in them, the
desire to know how he adjusted himself to the
everyday life, and took its little defeats and encouragements,
springs very strongly. It is the
natural interest that one takes in men of his cordial
humanity, and it is disappointing to be balked of
its satisfaction.</p>

<p>The outline of Dekker’s life is indeed singularly
blank. We do not know exactly when he
was born, or where; there is scarcely any clue to
the important period of his youth, and his early
struggles as a poet and playwright; we do not
even know when he died. A few further entries in
Henslowe’s Diary, whose value an uneasy sense of
J. Payne Collier’s editorial methods tends to
depreciate, and a few incidental references in
Dekker’s own works, chiefly in the dedications and
introductions to his plays, form the whole of the
exact record which we have to rely upon.</p>

<p>In the dedication to <i>Match Me in London</i>, perhaps
the most interesting of all the plays by him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
not included in this volume, which was published
in 1631, he says, sadly enough, “I have been a
Priest in Apollo’s Temple many years, my voice is
decaying with my Age, yet yours being clear and
above mine shall much honour me, if you but listen
to my old tunes.” Again in 1637, in the dedicatory
epistle of his prose tract, <i>English Villainies Seven
Several Times Pressed to Death</i>, he refers more
definitely to his “three-score years.” Sixty years
back from 1637 gives us 1577, but as Collier<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> tells us
that he was married before 1594, and as we know
that he had already won recognition as a young
playwright in 1597, it will be well to read the
term “three-score years” pretty freely, as meaning
generally the term between sixty and seventy, and
to put down the date of his birth at about the year
1569-70, or even a little earlier.</p>

<p>There is less uncertainty about his birthplace:
various references in his prose tracts prove pretty
certainly that he was born in London, as seems so
fit in one of the most devoted of those poets who
have celebrated the English capital. “O thou
beautifullest daughter of two united Monarchies!”
he cries, in his <i>Seven Deadly Sins of London</i>;
“from thy womb received I my being, from thy
breasts my nourishment.” This is confirmed by
similar passages in the <i>Dead Term</i>, <i>The Rod for
Runaways</i>, and other of the prose pamphlets. The
particular spot in London where he was born
is not however to be learnt, although Collier sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>mises
that he was born in Southwark. The name
itself,&mdash;whether Dekker or Decker, suggests a
Dutch origin, which is further corroborated by
the curious knowledge shown in the plays and
prose tracts of Dutch people and Dutch books, to
say nothing of the frequent Dutch realism of
Dekker’s dramatic method. Dr. Grosart, whose
indefatigable energy of research was probably
never exercised to so little purpose in the case
of any author, discovered on the title-page of one
copy of the civic “Entertainment” by Dekker,
<i>Troia-Nova-Triumphans, or London Triumphing</i>,
the words “Merchant-Tailor” written opposite his
name, as if by one who had known him. From
this we may again conjecture that his father was
a tailor, and that possibly the boy went to
Merchant Tailor’s School, and was intended for
that trade. The intimate knowledge of the daily
routine of tailors’ and shoemakers’ shops displayed
in <i>The Shoemaker’s Holiday</i>, and other of the plays,
bear every evidence of being drawn from actual
experience. It is not a very wild imagination,
therefore, to imagine that the boy Dekker may
have been apprenticed in the ordinary way as a
shoemaker or tailor, making escape from the craftsman’s
life as his poetic ambition grew hot, and at
last inevitable, in its hazardous issue upon the path
of a playwright and man of letters.</p>

<p>It is only by free inference from his works that
we can possibly fill up the early part of his life,
until, in 1597, as already noted, we find him com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>mitted
to the life of an author and playwright, and
tasting, no doubt, of its sweets, as in the early part
of 1598 he had a sharp foretaste of its bitterness.
Much of the description in his plays casts a vivid
light upon this wild life of the playhouse and
tavern which he, with other young poets of the extraordinary
decade terminating the sixteenth century
must have lived. Some of the scenes in <i>The
Honest Whore</i>, and again in <i>Satiromastix</i> and
other of the lesser known comedies, are full of
this interest; and luminous passages also occur
in the plays of his various collaborators. In
some of his own prose works, especially in his
singular guide to the gallant’s life in Elizabethan
London, <i>The Gull’s Horn Book</i>, Dekker has indirectly
supplied a still more realistic account of
the life lived by the young bloods who frequented
the playhouses and taverns. From this inimitable
book one gathers much curious detail for the picture
of Dekker’s daily surroundings. In Chapter V.,
which is headed, “How a Gallant should behave
himself in an Ordinary,” the young hero of the
period is advised to repair to the “ordinary,” or
eating-house, so early as “some half-hour after
eleven; for then you shall find most of your
fashion-mongers planted in the room waiting for
meat.” Amongst the types of gallant to whom
Dekker gives special advice as to behaviour at the
ordinary, is the <span class="lock">poet:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If you be a Poet,” he says, “and come into the Ordinary;
though it can be no great glory to be an ordinary Poet; order yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
thus. Observe no man; doff not cap to that gentleman to-day at
dinner, to whom, not two nights since, you were beholden for a
supper; but, after a turn or two in the room, take occasion,
pulling out your gloves, to have some <i>Epigram</i>, or <i>Satire</i>, or
<i>Sonnet</i> fastened in one of them.... Marry, if you chance to get
into your hands any witty thing of another man’s, that is somewhat
better; I would counsel you then, if demand be made
who composed it, you may say: ‘Faith, a learned Gentleman,
a very worthy friend.’ And this seeming to lay it on another man
will be counted either modesty in you, or a sign that you are not
ambitious of praise, or else that you dare not take it upon you
for fear of the sharpness it carries with it.”</p></div>

<p>At dinner, directions are given in the same vein of
irony, as to the manner of eating and so forth; and
after dinner, among other occupations and diversions
proposed for the afternoon figures the play.
The next chapter is devoted accordingly to
expounding “How a Gallant should behave himself
in a Playhouse.” From the point of view of
Dekker’s dramatic work, this is naturally the most
interesting part of the book. It gives us a vivid
idea of the associations which would colour his
thoughts as, the dinner hour over, the stream of
gallants, ’prentices and so forth, issued from the
ordinaries, the fashionable promenade in the
Middle Aisle of St. Paul’s, and elsewhere, and
wended their way at afternoon to the play. Dekker,
it is quite evident, speaks feelingly, remembering
his own troubles, in these ironical counsellings to
the “Gull,” who in his seat on the stage seems to
have acted as a sort of irresponsible <i>chorus</i>, hindering
rather than aiding the understanding of the
play, however, and resented equally by the playwright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
and the playgoers in pit or gallery.
“Whither,” proceeds the Horn Book,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Whither therefore the gatherers of the public, or private Playhouse
stand to receive the afternoon’s rent; let our Gallant having
paid it, presently advance himself up to the Throne of the stage; I
mean not into the lord’s room, which is now but the stage’s suburbs;
no, ... but on the very rushes where the comedy is to dance,
yea, and under the state of Cambyses himself, must our feathered
ostrich, like a piece of ordnance, be planted valiantly, because impudently,
beating down the mews and hisses of the opposed
rascality.” Here it continues&mdash;“By sitting on the stage, you may,
without travelling for it, at the very next door ask whose play it is;
and, by that <i>Quest of Inquiry</i>, the law warrants you to avoid much
mistaking; if you know not the author, you may rail against him,
and peradventure so behave yourself, that you may enforce the author
to know you.”</p></div>

<p>The refinements of torture to which the Elizabethan
playwright was subject under this arrangement,
must indeed have been infinite. Dekker
further enlarges with the piteous irony of a long-suffering
<span class="lock">experience:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It shall crown you with rich commendation, to laugh aloud in
the middest of the most serious and saddest scene of the terriblest
tragedy; and to let that clapper, your tongue, be tossed so high,
that all the house may ring of it.”</p></div>

<p>Again, even more <span class="lock">suggestively&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Now, sir; if the writer be a fellow that hath either epigrammed
you, or hath had a flirt at your mistress, or hath brought either your
feather, or your red beard, or your little legs, etc., on the stage;
you shall disgrace him worse than by tossing him in a blanket, or
giving him the bastinado in a tavern, if, in the middle of his play,
be it Pastoral or Comedy, Moral or Tragedy, you rise with a screwed
and discontented face from your stool to be gone.”</p></div>

<p>From another passage, it is clear that the first
arrival of the gallant upon the stage, as seen from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
the front of the house, must have been almost as
striking as this precipitate exit.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Present not yourself on the stage,” it advises “especially at a
new play, until the quaking Prologue hath, by rubbing, got colour
into his cheeks, and is ready to give the trumpets their cue that he
is upon point to enter; for then it is time, as though you were one
of the properties, or that you dropt out of the hangings, to creep
from behind the arras, with your tripos or three-footed stool, in one
hand, and a teston (tester,&mdash;sixpence) mounted between a forefinger
and a thumb in the other.”</p></div>

<p>From the ordinary to the playhouse, from the
playhouse to the tavern, the satirist follows still
as good-humouredly:&mdash;“the next places that are
filled, after the playhouses be emptied are, or ought
to be, taverns; into a tavern then let us next march,
where the brains of one hogshead must be beaten
out to make up another.”</p>

<p>The ordinary, the playhouse, the tavern:&mdash;Dekker
no doubt knew them only too well, but
it is not to be inferred because of this that his
life was an idle one. His extraordinary energy,
at the beginning of his career at any rate,
becomes clear when we turn to the record of his
plays. We have already referred to those which
he had been engaged to write for Henslowe, and
which no doubt were written and duly performed
before the appearance of <i>The Shoemaker’s Holiday</i>,
the first of those actually remaining to us. The
year 1599 especially, towards the middle of which
<i>The Shoemaker’s Holiday</i> was published, must have
been a year of immense activity. On the 9th and
16th April, Henslowe records a play by Dekker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
and Chettle, <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>. On the 2nd
of May, a payment of five shillings was made
to him, “in earnest of a book called <i>Orestes’
Furies</i>,” and again in the same month there are
payments to him and Chettle, for <i>The Tragedy of
Agamemnon</i>. In July and August, <i>The Step-mother’s
Tragedy</i>, is mentioned; and on the 1st of
August, he receives forty shillings “for a book
called <i>Bear-a-brain</i>.” In September he is associated
with Jonson and Chettle, “on account of a
play called <i>Robert the Second, King of Scots
Tragedy</i>.” In January, 1599-1600, a book called
<i>Truth’s Supplication to Candlelight</i> is mentioned,
and the next month <i>The Spanish Moor’s Tragedy</i>
in which Haughton and Day appear to have
collaborated, and which, it has been thought, is
the same as the play called <i>Lust’s Dominion</i>
sometime assigned to Marlowe. This has brought
us past the time of the publication of <i>The
Shoemaker’s Holiday</i>, the first edition of which
probably appeared in July, 1599, if we are right in
taking the entry against the 17th of that month in
Henslowe’s Diary to refer to the buying of a book
actually published, and not one merely in MS.</p>

<p><i>The Shoemaker’s Holiday</i> represents Dekker
admirably on the side of his facile humour and
bright dramatic realism, as <i>Old Fortunatus</i>,
which must have followed it very closely, represents
him on the more purely poetical side.
Taken as a whole, and as a successful accomplishment
of what it attempts, this hearty comedy&mdash;so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
full of overflowing good humour&mdash;gives us Dekker
on his happiest side. It displays all that genial
interest in everything human, all that ready democratic
sympathy, which, among the Elizabethans,
Dekker has peculiarly displayed. The comedy is
indeed the most perfect presentation of the brightness
and social interest of the everyday Elizabethan
life which is to be found in the English drama. It
realises with admirable vividness certain simpler
types of character, of which the <i>people</i>, as opposed
to the aristocratic classes from which most of the
dramatists drew their characters, was formed. The
craftsman’s life, merging itself in the citizen’s, is the
end and all of the play; the King himself is but a
shadow of social eminence compared with the Lord
Mayor. Simon Eyre, the shoemaker, jolliest, most
exuberant of all comedy types, is the very incarnation
of the hearty English character on its prosperous
workaday side, untroubled by spiritual misgivings
and introspections; and he is so set amidst
the rest of the characters as to delightfully fulfil the
joyous main intention of the play.</p>

<p>The plot proper, as stated in the prose Argument,
dealing with the romance of Lacy and his disguise
as a shoemaker in order to win the love of Rose,
is of less consequence indeed than the interest
centred in the doings of Simon Eyre and his
journeymen in the shoemaker’s shop. Of these
Firk is a capital low-comedy character, a healthy,
lusty animal, serving as an excellent dramatic
foil to his more delicate companion Ralph, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
Lacy in his disguise as Hans, the Dutchman. Of
the female characters, Eyre’s wife is a good sample
of foolish, conventional femininity, well realised
in the little she has to say and do. The most
taking of the female parts, however, is Jane: the
whole episode of Ralph’s going to the wars, his
delayed return to her, her wooing by Hammon,
and her final rescue at the last moment by the band
of shoemakers, is worked out with singular sweetness,
and with great feeling for simple dramatic
effect. One of the prettiest scenes in the whole of
Dekker, is that where Jane is shown sitting alone in
the shop sewing when Hammon approaches, and
tries by fair means and foul to win her love. Compared
with her, Rose, the heroine in chief, is indistinct.
Sybil, the maid, however, is an excellent
counterpart to Firk, the feminine to his masculine,&mdash;as
unabashed in her innuendo as he in his blunt
animalism.</p>

<p>Taken all through, this “Pleasant Comedy of
the Gentle Craft” is one to be remembered with
the score or so of the best comedies of pure joy
of life which were produced by the Elizabethans;
and remembered it probably will be even when
Dekker’s stronger and maturer work is overlooked.
The abounding happiness that fills it is contagious;
only here and there the note of trouble for Ralph
and Jane occurs to set off the unadulterated comedy
of the rest. The whole spirit of the play is expressed
in the words of Simon Eyre when he sums up his
philosophy for the edification of the Lord Mayor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
who says to him, laughing&mdash;“Ha, ha, ha! I had
rather than a thousand pound, I had an heart but
half so light as yours;” and Eyre replies, “Why,
what should I do, my Lord? A pound of care
pays not a dram of debt. Hum, let’s be merry
whiles we are young; old age, sack and sugar, will
steal upon us, ere we be aware.” As pointed out
in the notes to the play, it is worth remembering
that Robert Herrick, who was a goldsmith’s apprentice
in London when the play was first performed
there, seems to have in part appropriated these
words of Eyre’s, and paraphrased them in one of
his inimitable verses. Dekker has himself twice
overflowed into song in the play, and the shoemaker’s
drinking-song shows at once the exquisite
lyric faculty which he possessed. Its chorus lingers
long in the memory as an echo of the happy, boisterous
life, well nourished with cakes and ale, of the
Elizabethan <span class="lock">craftsman:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="container">
<div class="centerpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Trowl the bowl, the jolly nut-brown bowl,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And here, kind mate, to thee:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let’s sing a dirge for Saint Hugh’s soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And down it merrily.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><i>The Shoemaker’s Holiday</i> serves well as an instance
of Dekker’s realistic method. One sees in it
a natural outcome of his prentice life in London,
as a shoemaker, a “seamster,” or what not. In
coming to <i>Old Fortunatus</i> on the other hand, we
have Dekker as pure poet and idealist. Instead of
the lusty zest of comedy, we have the romantic
spirit in its perfection; the glamour of romance is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
cast over everything. Founded upon one of those
fabulous histories in which the sixteenth century
so loved to indulge its imagination, the play appeals
directly to the sense of wonder and adventure
which the poets, playwrights and story-tellers of
the day, could always count upon in their audience.
As pointed out in the preliminary note to the play,
Dekker’s version is founded upon an earlier one
which was performed some three years before he
began his. It would be interesting to discover what
the character of the original version was, both in its
general lines and in its details. In his admirable
book, “Studies in the Literary Relations of England
and Germany in the sixteenth century,” Mr. C. H.
Herford has pointed out the resemblance in certain
parts of the original legend and of the play to the
story of Faustus. This indirectly leads us to the
consideration of how far the writer of the earlier
play may have been influenced, if at all, by the
dramatic method of Marlowe. For in some
parts of Dekker’s version, the resemblance in
the structure of the blank verse on occasion,
and in the scenic and other detail, to Marlowe
is striking. Only, in the verse, it is <i>Tamburlaine</i>
rather than <i>Dr. Faustus</i> that is suggested, as for
instance in Fortune’s address to Fortunatus, when
she appears to him with her array of discrowned
kings and kings new-created.</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="centerpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“These have I ruined, and exalted those:<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>The preceding passage, beginning “Thou shalt
be one of Fortune’s minions,” which contains too a
direct reference <span class="lock">to&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="container">
<div class="centerpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">“that great Scythian swain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fortune’s best minion, warlike Tamburlaine,”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>is still more like Marlowe. Dekker’s verse, it
is true, does not march mail-clad like Marlowe’s:
it has a plasticity and a suppleness which the
other’s “mighty line” lacked, while it fails to
achieve the same state and sustained dignity. But
after all differences are allowed for, there is
much in the blank verse in some parts of <i>Old
Fortunatus</i>, which only Marlowe could have
inspired.</p>

<p>This is not said with any thought of depreciating
Dekker, who has so often been depreciated in order
to add to the lustre of others, but because it marks
an interesting point in his development as a poet
and dramatist. Two things were enough in themselves
to prevent his carrying on the tradition of
Marlowe: one, and an insuperable one, his faculty
of humour; the second, springing from the first,
his lack of that sense of his own artistic dignity,
failing which his genius never rose to its potential
height. Signs of the power to achieve the very
highest in poetry are scattered extravagantly all
through ‘<i>Old Fortunatus</i>,’ so that one does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
wonder at Charles Lamb’s tremendous compliment.
There are lines in it which have rarely
been surpassed, and there are fewer lapses in the
play than is usual with Dekker, in the inspired
recklessness of his method. Dekker’s theory of
blank verse, in especial, was not a severe one. It
admitted of a free interspersion of rhymed lines,
and of other dubious modifications of the strict
measure. But it is remarkable how successful
many of the passages are in spite of these
irregularities. Dekker had the privilege of genius,
and the faculty of putting into words that
rhythmical unction and natural charm which defy
the exacter laws of prosody.</p>

<p>Part of the structural defects of the play are due
to one of those exigencies to which the Elizabethan
playwrights were peculiarly liable. Mr. C. H.
Herford, in the book before alluded to, has shewn
that Dekker had practically finished the play on
the lines of the original fable of Fortunatus, when
it was ordered for performance at Court, whereupon
further special additions were made with a view
to this. Thus, it will be perceived that there
are two prologues; while a serious interference
with the original lines of the play is shown
in the intrusion of Virtue and Vice, in the
fashion of a “Masque” or “Triumph,” so as to
upset the simple dramatic motive of the supremacy
of Fortune. In this way, as Mr. Herford
says, the right moral tension of the tragedy gives
way to the decorous conventionalities of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
Masque. For, the apparent moral effect gained by
the triumph of Virtue over Vice and over Fortune
is only one of appearance. Dekker had already,
according to his wont, moralised the original
story, which is innocent of moral intention. For
instance, Andelocia, who like Fortunatus is in
Dekker’s hands a prodigal upon whom Fortune
wreaks a tragic retribution, is in the original
romance a hero to the last, using the immoral
supremacy afforded by the Purse and Wishing Cap
without either moral recoil or material injury to
himself.</p>

<p>There are other parts, fine in themselves, but
insufficiently related to the main line of the plot,
whose inconsequence can not be excused because
of any exterior later addition, as for instance, the
Orleans episode. It is hard, at the same time,
to have to find fault with an intrusion which
has resulted so delightfully in itself; and we may
best take leave of the play in the tempered eulogy
of Mr. J. Addington Symonds, who, after speaking
of certain of these defects, goes on to say, “Among
the poet’s most perfect achievements, however, are
the scenes in which Orleans indulges a lover’s
lunacy in a passion of wild fancies. To quote
passages would be to murder the effect. Nothing
can be imagined finer than the paradoxes of this
witty fanatic, in whose opinion the whole world is
mad and he the only wise man left; who scorns the
scorn of sober folk, extols deformity, and adores
the very horns that sprout upon his lady’s brow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
The mastery of Dekker is shown throughout this
comedy in the flesh and blood reality which he
has given to abstractions; even the subordinate
characters define each a clearly defined quality.
Fortunatus and his sons have a higher degree of
reality; while Virtue, Vice, and Fortune, withdrawn
from human action and anxiety, survey the
world from thrones and feel such passions only as
befits immortals. They enter and depart in pomps
and pageants to solemn strains of music.... To
have conceived the comedy of <i>Old Fortunatus</i>
proves Dekker a poet of no common order. A
little more firmness in its ground-plan would have
made it a masterpiece.”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>It may seem that undue attention has been given
to these two plays, but in them will be found so
characteristic an embodiment of Dekker’s qualities
as a playwright,&mdash;as a realistic writer of comedy
and as a romantic poet, that they serve as an
admirable illustration of the whole of his dramatic
works. The next play of which we have any
record is the famous burlesque upon Ben Jonson,
<i>Satiromastix</i>, which was published in 1602. As
an artistic whole, this deserves, no doubt, all that
has been said against it; Dekker’s awkward fashion
of interweaving two more or less inconsequent
dramatic motives was never displayed more unfortunately.
But as a young poet’s retort upon an
unsparing antagonist of Ben Jonson’s autocratic
position, the thing is surely not contemptible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
The exaggerated reproduction of Jonson’s Captain
Tucca, in especial, which has been pointed to as
proving a lack of invention on Dekker’s part, was
no doubt one of the favourite hits of the piece, an
out-Heroding of Herod which could not fail to
immensely tickle the playgoers of the day. And
the appearance of Horace cleverly got up in imitation
of the author of <i>The Poetaster</i>, labouring over
an ode by candlelight, must have brought down
the house.</p>

<p>What is remarkable about Dekker’s retort is its
perfect good-humour; there is not a trace of
vindictiveness in all its satire. Dekker probably
took up the cudgels, as beforetime he first entered
upon the literary career, more “for the fun of it,”
than with any very deliberate or serious intention.
Though the episode of Cœlestine has no conceivable
reference to the “Untrussing of the Humourous
Poet,” it is worth turning to for its own sake. Mr.
Swinburne’s conjecture that this part of the play
was originally designed for another purpose, and
was only used here for want of material to fill out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
the Jonson burlesque to the required length, is
probably the correct one.</p>

<p>The reputation which Dekker won by <i>Satiromastix</i>
seems to have been the cause of something of a
new departure in the year following its publication;
we find him then appearing for the first time as a
prose-writer. He had already been engaged in
writing <i>Canaan’s Calamity; the Destruction of
Jerusalem</i>, in sensational doggrel,&mdash;the wretched
hack-work of a few hasty hours, no doubt, written
for some urgent bookseller, which I am afraid there
is no sufficient reason to think with Mr. Swinburne
that he did not compose. And now he may be said
to have seriously begun his career as a man of
letters, as distinct from a playwright, by the publication
of an interesting work whose title-page
well suggests its contents. The title runs:&mdash;<i>The
Wonderful Year</i>: “Wherein is shewed the picture
of London lying sick of the Plague. At the end
of all (like a merry Epilogue to a dull Play) certain
tales are cut out in sundry fashions of purpose to
shorten the lives of long winter’s nights, that lie
watching in the dark for us.” Passages in this work
show clearly enough that Dekker had the making
in him too of a prose writer, if he could only learn
to master and rightly direct his faculty of words,
but there is no pervading sense of the art of prose
in it. Immediately following <i>The Wonderful
Year</i>, however, came another prose-work which
in its way is perfect. <i>The Bachelor’s Banquet</i> is
a delightful satire on the life matrimonial, “plea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>santly
discoursing the variable humours of women,
their quickness of wits and unsearchable deceits.”
Here we have Dekker at his best. His facile
humour for once served him capably from beginning
to end, and the result is a satire of inimitable pleasantry,
full of his hearty spontaneity of fun, and all
the more effective because, like <i>Satiromastix</i>, it is
so devoid of any real offence. As if to offer atonement
for having satirised woman-kind at all, it must
have been about this time that he collaborated with
Haughton and Chettle, in <i>The Pleasant Comedy of
Patient Grissill</i>, with its charming picture of a
woman’s ideal patience. As this play is to be
given in a later volume, it need not be examined at
length here.</p>

<p>And now, in 1604, we come to the work, of all
Dekker’s, which most fully and characteristically
represents his genius, with its fund of great qualities
and great defects&mdash;<i>The Honest Whore</i>. The
second part of the play, it is true, was not published
until many years later, but it will be convenient
to take both parts together in considering
it here, noting only significant changes in style
and so forth. With the play as a whole, Hazlitt’s
well-known criticism has become so inseparably
identified and forms so incomparable an exposition,
that I prefer to give it here instead of commentary
of my own, completing it by what further
notes seem to be required.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Old honest Dekker’s Signior Orlando Friscobaldo I shall never
forget! I became only of late acquainted with this last-mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>
worthy character! but the bargain between us is, I trust, for life.
We sometimes regret that we had not sooner met with characters
like this, that seem to raise, revive, and give a new zest to our
being.... The execution is, throughout, as exact as the
conception is new and masterly. There is the least colour possible
used; the pencil drags; the canvas is almost seen through: but
then, what precision of outline, what truth and purity of tone, what
firmness of hand, what marking of character! The words and
answers all along are so true and pertinent, that we seem to see the
gestures, and to hear the tone with which they are accompanied. So
when Orlando, disguised, says to his daughter, ‘You’ll forgive me,’
and she replies, ‘I am not marble, I forgive you;’ or again, when
she introduces him to her husband, saying simply, ‘It is my father,’
there needs no stage-direction to supply the relenting tones of voice
or cordial frankness of manner with which these words are spoken.
It is as if there were some fine art to chisel thought, and to embody
the inmost movements of the mind in every-day actions and familiar
speech.</p>

<p>“Simplicity and extravagance of style, homeliness and quaintness,
tragedy and comedy, interchangeably set their hands and seals to
this admirable production. We find the simplicity of prose with the
graces of poetry. The stalk grows out of the ground; but the
flowers spread their flaunting leaves in the air. The mixture of
levity in the chief character bespeaks the bitterness from which it
seeks relief; it is the idle echo of fixed despair, jealous of observation
or pity. The sarcasm quivers on the lip, while the tear stands congealed
on the eyelid. This ‘tough senior,’ this impracticable old
gentleman, softens into a little child; this choke-pear melts in the
mouth like marmalade. In spite of his resolute professions of misanthropy,
he watches over his daughter with kindly solicitude; plays
the careful housewife; broods over her lifeless hopes; nurses the
decay of her husband’s fortune, as he had supported her tottering
infancy; saves the high-flying Matheo from the gallows more than
once, and is twice a father to them. The story has all the romance
of private life, all the pathos of bearing up against silent grief, all the
tenderness of concealed affection: there is much sorrow patiently
borne, and then comes peace.... The manner too in
which Infelice, the wife of Hippolito, is made acquainted with her
husband’s infidelity, is finely dramatic; and in the scene where she
convicts him of his injustice, by taxing herself with incontinence
first, and then turning his most galling reproaches to her into upbraidings
against his own conduct, she acquits herself with infinite
spirit and address. The contrivance by which, in the first part, after
being supposed dead, she is restored to life, and married to Hippolito,
though perhaps a little far-fetched, is affecting and romantic.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span></p>

<p>It must be constantly borne in mind, when
reading the two parts of the play, that an interval
of twenty-five years separates them, and that
Orlando Friscobaldo is the creation of an obviously
more matured imagination than are the
characters of the earlier part. Indeed, the way in
which Bellafront’s casual mention of her father’s
name in the earlier part is developed into so
masterly a characterisation is very significant.
In the period between, Dekker had gone through
strange and bitter experience. According to
Collier, he married early, and a daughter was
baptised in his name as early as 1594, and we can
only wonder what dark sorrow he had known, that
he came to shape out of himself the inexpressible
tragi-comedy of Bellafront’s shame and her father’s
love. There is all the difference between youth
and age, indeed, in the two parts; and it is impressive
to note how a conception, prompted
mainly by the humourist’s artistic interest in the
first instance, came to be wrought out and carried
to the end with such a bitter freight of actuality.
In this grim masterpiece, Dekker has used his
realistic method with terrible sincerity, and yet, with
so cunning a grasp of the nettle of shame that
with its sting it yields a fragrance as of the perfect
flower of love. The weakest parts of the play are
those where Dekker conforms most to conventional
dramatic methods, as in the forensic contest between
Bellafront and Hippolito, which is dramatically
weak, though in passages not ineffective. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>
Henslowe’s Diary, Middleton is mentioned as a
collaborator in the play with Dekker, and there
are parts of it which might very well be from his
hand. Mr. A. H. Bullen conjectures that the scenes
where Bellafront is first discovered in her chamber
and again the shop scenes where the gallants try
to irritate Candido, are chiefly Middleton’s. Mr. J.
Addington Symonds considers also that the play
as a whole has “the movement of one of Middleton’s
acknowledged plays.” Making due allowance
for every assistance of the kind, the essential
merit of the whole work is so unmistakeably
Dekker’s, however, that the reader may safely
leave Middleton out of court in considering the
play as a whole, and put it down as Dekker’s to
all intents and purposes.</p>

<p>Before the publication of the first part, Dekker
had, in 1603, in his <i>Magnificent Entertainment
given to King James</i>, inserted some lines of
Middleton’s, which proves that they were in contact
about the time when the play was being
written. After its publication Dekker apparently
gave himself up for a while to prose-writing. In
1606, one of his best known pamphlets, <i>The
Seven Deadly Sins of London</i>, appeared, which
he himself affirmed on the title-page was only
a week’s work, “Opus Septem Dierum.” The
satire, though here and there forced, and roughly
written, is not unimpressive, and contains many
passages of vivid imaginative power. The Seven
Deadly Sins, or as Dekker has it, “The Names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span>
of the Actors in this Old Interlude of Iniquity,”
are not at all what one would be likely to expect.
The terms by which they are designated are
extravagantly metaphorical, and including “Politic
Bankruptism,” “Candlelight,” and “Shaving,” and
there is a special addendum to say that “Seven
may easily play this, but not without a Devil.”
Published in the same year, <i>News from Hell,
brought by the Devil’s Carrier</i>, which resolves
itself into “The Devil’s Answer to Pierce Pennylesse,”
is a confused, gruesomely humoresque description
of the nether regions, and of a Mephistophelian
journey thence to London and other
places in the upper world. <i>The Double PP</i>, a
rather ungainly satire on the Papists, partly in
prose, partly in verse, inspired by the Gunpowder
Plot of 1605, also appeared in 1606.</p>

<p>The year 1607 shows Dekker at his worst as a
playwright. The production of <i>The Whore of
Babylon</i> marks the low-water mark of his unfortunate
career. It is a sort of allegory, presenting
Elizabeth as Titania, and other national and international
topics in a hopelessly cumbrous disguise.
As a rule Dekker illuminates even his hastiest
productions with some gleam of true humour or
imagination, but here there is hardly a redeeming
touch of either, or, if one does exist, the dull
atmosphere of the whole keeps it hidden from
sight. Dekker atoned a little for his sins as a
playwright in this year, however, by the issue of an
interesting miscellany of prose writings, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>
comprehensive title may be quoted in full:&mdash;<i>Jests
to make you Merry</i>: “With the Conjuring up of Cock
Watt (the Walking Spirit of Newgate) to tell tales.
Unto which is added the Misery of a Prison, and a
Prisoner. And a Paradox in Praise of Serjeants.
Written by T. D. and George Wilkins.” George
Wilkins, says Dr. Grosart, “was in a small way a
contemporary playwright;” and it is impossible to
say exactly what share he may have had in this
strange composition. But some of the little stories
among the “Jests” bear very clearly Dekker’s touch,
and “The Misery of a Prison and a Prisoner” is
unmistakeably the pitiful and bitter expression of
his own sorry experiences. In this year was also
re-issued under the new title of <i>A Knight’s Conjuring
done in Earnest, discovered in Jest</i>, the
before-mentioned <i>News from Hell</i>, without anything
to show that the book was chiefly a republication.
There are some few additions to it,
however, including an interesting vision of Chaucer,
Spenser, Marlowe, Greene, Peele, and Nash in the
haunts of Apollo.</p>

<p>Now, too, we find Dekker in collaboration with
Webster, in the plays <i>Westward Ho</i>, <i>Northward
Ho</i>, and <i>Sir Thomas Wyatt</i>. Of these, the first
two are lively comedies of intrigue, affording many
striking pictures of contemporary life, grossly
realistic often, but not more so than is usual in
comedies of the time. In <i>Northward Ho</i> the social
diversions of the Greenshields and the Mayberrys
are amusingly contrived, and there are passages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span>
in <i>Westward Ho</i> of a higher and poetic kind, as
in the passage (Act iv., Sc. ii.) quoted by Mr. J.
A. Symonds in his essay on <span class="lock">Dekker:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="container">
<div class="centerpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">“Go let Music<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charm with her excellent voice an awful silence<br /></span>

<span class="i0">May, on the wings of air, in thousand forms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invisibly fly, yet be enjoyed.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The speeches of the earl in this play contain other
rare imaginative touches, in strange contrast with
the reckless farcical tenour of the piece generally.
<i>Sir Thomas Wyatt</i> is less satisfactory, a medley of
absurd printer’s errors adding to the confusion of
what was probably a confused work at best.
Marston’s protest, as to the unfairness of taking
seriously and critically plays which were hastily
and carelessly written to meet the demand of the
hour, must be remembered in judging plays like
this. In addition to the plays which their authors
revised and set forth with their deliberate <i>imprimatur</i>,
many were written without any idea of
publication; the playwrights looked upon them
merely as a sort of journalism, which they did
not wish to have judged by permanent artistic
standards. It would be waste of time to deliberate
over the exact share to be alloted to Dekker and
Webster in these three plays. It will be noted,
however, in the two comedies, that certain of the
characters, as the Welsh captain and Hans in
<i>Northward Ho</i>, speak in a dialect suspiciously like
that of the dialect parts in Dekker’s other plays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span></p>

<p>For the next two or three years Dekker appears
to have occupied himself again chiefly with prose.
In 1608 appeared <i>The Bellman of London</i>, which is
a sort of unconventional cyclopedia of thieving and
vagabondage, containing much curious information
about the shady side of Elizabethan life. Its
importance in relation to Dekker’s fondness for
the same subject-maker in his plays, however, is
somewhat lessened when we discover that the
work is partly appropriated from a book first
published about forty years before, in 1567,
entitled <i>A Caveat or Warning for Common
Cursitors, vulgarly called Vagabonds</i>; by Thomas
Harman. <i>The Bellman of London</i> seems to have
been successful; for it was followed the next year
by a second book of the same kind, <i>Lanthorn and
Candle-light; or, The Bellman’s Second Night Walk</i>:
also in part taken from Harman. In 1609 <i>The Gull’s
Horn-book</i>, which has already been referred to, was
published,&mdash;by far the most important and interesting
of all Dekker’s prose works. Its value will be
apparent from the passages already quoted, but to
anyone who wishes to realise intimately the everyday
life of the time, and its relation to Dekker’s
own environment, the book is simply indispensable.
The initial conception, like most of Dekker’s
conceptions, was not original. The idea of it is
taken from a Dutch book which Dekker had
thought of translating into English verse, but,
finding difficulties in the way, he decided instead
to write a new prose work on the same lines. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>
earlier parts of the book are the least reliable, as
here Dekker made free use of the Dutch original;
but from Chap. iv., “How a Gallant should
behave Himself in Paul’s Walk,” onwards, the
book is probably as true as it is humorously
realistic in its descriptions, forming a delightful
prose complement to the plays. The rest of
Dekker’s prose works, interesting as they are in themselves,
have not enough bearing upon the plays to
warrant me in any lengthy examination of them.
Between the two “Bellman” books appeared <i>The
Dead Term; or, Westminster’s Complaint for Long
Vacations and Short Terms</i>, which, amid some
extravagance, contains a great deal in the way of
description of London life, which is picturesque
and historically valuable. In 1609 two other works
followed or preceded <i>The Gull’s Horn-book</i>. The
most valuable of the two is entitled, <i>Work for
Armourers; or, the Peace is Broken</i>, which contains
some suggestive autobiographical references to
Dekker’s delight in history, to the hard lot of
poetry and the drama, and to many other matters,
interesting, personally, in approaching its main
fancifully treated thesis of the struggle between
<i>Poverty and Money</i>. <i>The Raven’s Almanack</i>, the
second of the two, is chiefly a budget of stories,
with “A Song sung by an Old Woman in a
Meadow,” which has something of Dekker’s
rougher lyrical quality in it.</p>

<p>In 1611 Dekker and Middleton came together
again, and wrote conjointly <i>The Roaring Girl</i>, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>
vigorous comedy, whose heroine, Moll Cutpurse,
goes about in the guise of a gallant, and wreaks
summary vengeance upon offenders. In spite of
her aggressive masculinity, she is somehow made
in her way really attractive. Some of the scenes,
as those in the “Sempster’s” shop, and those in
which the Gallipots and Tiltyards go duck-hunting,
are full of contemporary colour. The Mayoralty
Pageant of 1612 has already been mentioned. In
that year also appeared an absurd semi-allegorical
dramatic fantasy by Dekker, founded upon Machiavelli’s
“Belphegor,”&mdash;<i>If this be not a Good Play
the Devil is in it</i>, in which Devils, Zanies, Friars,
Dancing Girls, and other human and superhuman
elements are wrought into a curious medley of
utter nonsense with real humour and fancy. From
1613 to 1616, Oldys informs us that Dekker was
in prison again. An interesting and pathetic letter
exists from him to Alleyne, who must have acted
generously towards him throughout; the letter is
dated “King’s Bench, Sept. 12, 1616.” It is significant
that in the first year of his re-imprisonment,
he issued a very remarkable book of prayers, entitled
<i>The Four Birds of Noah’s Ark</i>, to the profound
eloquence and power of devotional expression
in which, as in “A Prayer for a Soldier,” Mr. Swinburne
has paid a well-deserved tribute. With <i>A
Strange Horse-Race</i>, published also in 1613, were
included the singular piece of humour,&mdash;“The
Devil’s last Will and Testament,” and another prose
fantasy, “The Bankrupt’s Banquet.” A much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span>
notable work is <i>Dekker his Dream</i>, which is mainly
in verse. It is a rough and unpolished piece of
work, most interesting autobiographically, but full
of vigorous and sometimes very imaginative
descriptions, and with occasional fine passages, as
two lines, taken almost at random, will <span class="lock">testify:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="container">
<div class="centerpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Each man was both the lion and the prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every corn-field an Aceldema.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Dekker did not emerge again as a playwright
until 1622, when he appears with still another
collaborator, the last man whom one would have
expected him to work with,&mdash;Massinger. They
wrote together <i>The Virgin Martyr</i>, which is, as
might be expected, a patchwork of incongruous
qualities. Dekker probably supplied both the
weakest and the strongest parts of the play, the
atrocious humorous passages, equally with the exquisitely
tender scene, for instance, between
Dorothea, the Virgin Martyr, and Angelo, “a good
spirit, serving Dorothea in the habit of a Page.”
This is the scene which won from Charles Lamb in
his “Specimens of the Elizabethan Dramatists,”
his unbounded tribute to Dekker’s genius; and
as the scene can be turned to there, I need not
repeat it here, as I should otherwise be inclined
to do.</p>

<p>There is no record of the next five years of
Dekker’s life. In 1628 and 1629 he again wrote
the Mayoralty pageants under title <i>Britannia’s
Honour</i>, and <i>London’s Tempe</i>, which at best con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span>tain
glimpses of his true quality. In 1631, <i>Match
Me in London</i>, a comedy of court intrigue in civic
life, has something of his real genius again. It
was in the dedicatory note of this play, to “The
Noble Lover, and deservedly beloved, of the Muses,
Ludovick Carlisle, Esquire, Gentleman of the Bows,
and Groom of the King and Queen’s Privy-Chamber,”
that Dekker so pathetically referred to his
voice, “Decaying with my Age.” But comparatively
with some of the second-rate pieces
of ten, and even twenty years before, there is
little sign of decay. <i>Match Me in London</i> shows,
it is true, the prose side of Dekker’s dramatic
faculty, rather than its side of poetic exuberance;
but the piece is as full of Dekker’s old picturesque
realism and genial humanity, as ever. The street
and shop scenes, supposed to be placed chiefly in
Seville, might just as well be in London: Dekker
transfers the ‘Counter’ there without hesitation, and
except for occasional doubtful attempts at Spanish
local colour, the whole play is as native as anything
Dekker has done. The plot turns chiefly upon the
attempt of the King to corrupt Tormiella, one of
the brightest and most taking of all Dekker’s
heroines, whose guileless fidelity to her husband
is delicately portrayed. The usual sub-plot in
which Don John, the King’s brother, conspires
for the throne, is less inconsequent than most
of Dekker’s supplementary plots, and the whole
comedy is managed with a higher sense of dramatic
form than Dekker often showed. <i>Match Me in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span>
London</i>, as being entirely Dekker’s own composition,
certainly deserves to rank with his half-dozen
best plays, and I am sorry that it was not
possible to find room for it in this edition,
although the same ground has already been
partly covered in his other comedies.</p>

<p>I confess I find it hard to understand how
anyone can seriously prefer <i>The Wonder of a Kingdom</i>,
which appeared some few years later, to <i>Match
Me in London</i>, as Mr. J. A. Symonds has done.
In the former we find Dekker for once working
without any real pervading humanity; there are
touches of his usual heartiness in it, but as a
whole it is a heartless production&mdash;more a cold
study of motives and passions than a sympathetic
re-creation of them in forms of art. It was highly
appropriate, indeed, that Dekker long before had
been chosen as a champion to meet Ben Jonson,
for the two men mark very clearly two types of
poet and artist. Jonson in his plays worked
largely from the mere curiosity about men’s
passions and motives, he wrought conceptions
which sprang too often from an analytical interest,
rather than the emotional human impulse which
drives the poet to reflect men’s strifes and
destinies for simple love’s sake. With Dekker it
was different. Without perhaps consciously realising
it, he worked mainly from this impulse of the
heart, putting himself passionately into all that he
characterised, in his exuberant, careless way. For
once, however, in <i>The Wonder of a Kingdom</i>, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>
seems to have laid aside something of his natural
kindliness. The episode of old Lord Vanni’s intrigue
with Alphonsina is repulsive, unvisited as it is by
even ordinary comedy retribution. It is only
fair to allow, however, that Dekker’s kindlier
quality crops up in some scenes of the play,
and Hazlitt’s testimony to Gentili, “that truly ideal
character of a magnificent patron,” may be set
against the comment of the German critic, Dr.
Schmidt, who has said very truly,&mdash;“That the
youthful fire which fills <i>Fortunatus</i> is in this drama
extinguished.”</p>

<p>Although the two remaining plays which
Dekker wrote with Ford, <i>The Sun’s Darling</i> and
<i>The Witch of Edmonton</i>, were not published till
1656 and 1658 respectively, they were certainly
written and performed long before <i>Match Me in
London</i>, probably helping to fill up the five blank
years following that in which <i>The Virgin Martyr</i>
appeared. <i>The Sun’s Darling</i> is a charming conception,
inadequately wrought out, but nevertheless
full of facile and exuberant poetic quality.
The lyrics, especially, the best of which are undoubtedly
Dekker’s, are so fresh and full of impulse
that one inclines to think that they date
back to the first half of his life. Some of these
have found their way, infrequently, into the anthologies,
as that beginning, “What bird so sings,
yet so does wail,” and again the delightful country
song, in which one can forgive the mixture of musk-roses
and daffodils, haymaking and hunting, lambs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span>
and partridges, in defiance of all rustic tradition, for
the sake of its catching <span class="lock">tune:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="container">
<div class="centerpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Hay-makers, rakers, reapers and mowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wait on your Summer Queen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dress up with musk-rose her eglantine bowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Daffodils strew the green....”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The hero of this Moral Masque, as the authors
term it,&mdash;Raybright, “The Sun’s Darling,” is shown
in progression through the seasons under the Sun’s
guidance, which he perverts in his restless pursuit
of sensuous pleasure. All these scenes are full of
suggestions of beauty, but they are imperfectly
realised. Exquisite passages occur, however, as
in the scene where Spring, Health, Youth, and
Delight appear to Raybright, and Spring, wooing
him in vain, proffers him the bay-<span class="lock">tree:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="container">
<div class="centerpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“That tree shall now be thine, about it sit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the old poets, with fresh laurel crowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Singing in verse the praise of chastity.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>When it is too late, Raybright, filled with love for
the Spring, is seized with remorse: so in turn
all the seasons pass by, while Humour and Folly
lead him always astray. The Sun’s peroration in
addressing Raybright at the end of his foiled career
is a solemn and profound, if rather fanciful, summing-up
of life. Altogether <i>The Sun’s Darling</i> forms a
valuable later complement to <i>Old Fortunatus</i>, and
it is only to be regretted that its authors did not
bestow upon it the longer, patient labour which
would have made it worthy of its conception.</p>

<p><i>The Witch of Edmonton</i>, the second play in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a></span>
which Ford and Dekker worked conjointly, is so
utterly different to <i>The Sun’s Darling</i> that one
finds it difficult to believe that the same hands can
have been concerned in its production. Possibly
the initial conception was Rowley’s, and though it
would not be easy to differentiate his exact share
in any special scene or passage, there is a considerable
residuum which marks itself off as unlike the
work of Dekker or Ford. Dekker’s share is more
apparent. The scenes where Cuddy Banks and his
fellow villagers disport themselves, some of those
where the Witch herself appears, and again those of
Susan’s love and sorrow, have by general critical
consent been awarded to him. Part of the severer
tragedy in the terrible hallucination of Mother
Sawyer, however, which has generally been considered
Dekker’s, I fancy bears the stamp of Ford.
In his essay on Ford, Mr. Swinburne has essayed a
comparison of the parts due severally to Dekker
and to Ford, which is too important to be overlooked.
He would assign the part of Mother
Sawyer chiefly to Dekker. “In all this part of the
play I trace the hand of Dekker; his intimate and
familiar sense of wretchedness, his great and
gentle spirit of compassion for the poor and suffering
with whom his own lot in life was so often
cast, in prison and out.” The part of Susan also,
he allots to Dekker; and of the scene where Frank
Thorney’s guilt is discovered, he remarks suggestively:
“The interview of Frank with the disguised
Winifred in this scene may be compared by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span>
student of dramatic style with the parting of the
same characters at the close; the one has all the
poignant simplicity of Dekker, the other all the
majestic energy of Ford.”</p>

<p>The dates of publication of the two last plays
bring us far beyond the time of Dekker’s death, of
which, however, we have no record at all. None
of his prose works reach so late a period; the last
is <i>A Rod for Runaways</i>, published in 1625.
Collier, who always made his evidence go as far as
possible, himself admits that there is no further
trace of him after 1638, the year when Milton
wrote <i>Lycidas</i>, the year when Scotland was
ominously signing the Covenant. In the further
oncoming of the Civil War, Dekker disappears
altogether, as uncertainly as he first entered the
scene.</p>

<p>In summing up this strange life and its dramatic
outcome, it is easily seen what is to be said on the
adverse side. Dekker had, let us admit, great
defects. He was the type of the prodigal in
literature,&mdash;the kindhearted, irresponsible poet
whom we all know, and love, and pardon seventy
times seven. But it is sad to think that with a
little of the common talent which every successful
man of affairs counts as part of his daily equipment,
he might have left a different record. He never
attained the serious conception of himself and his
dignity as a worker which every poet, every artist
must have, who would take effect proportionate to
his genius. He never seemed to become conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span>
in any enduring way of his artistic function, and
he constantly threw aside, under pressure of the
moment, those standards of excellence which none
knew better than he how to estimate. But after
all has been said, he remains, by his faults as well
as by his faculties, one of the most individual, one
of the most suggestive, figures of the whole Elizabethan
circle. Because of the breath of simple
humanity in them, his works leave a sense of
brightness and human encouragement whose charm
lingers when many more careful monuments of
literary effort are forgotten. His artistic sincerity
has resulted in a picture of life as he saw it, unequalled
for its sentiment, for its living spirit of tears
and laughter, as well as for its outspoken truth.
His homely realism brings before us all the pleasant
everyday bustle of the Elizabethan streets&mdash;the
craftsmen and prentices, the citizens at their shop
doors, the gallants in the Middle Aisle of St. Paul’s.
The general feeling is that of a summer’s morning
in the pleasant Cheapside of those days&mdash;more like
the street of a little market-town than the Cheapside
of to-day&mdash;where in the clear sunny air the
alert cry of the prentices, “What do you lack?”
rings out cheerily, and each small incident of the
common life is touched with vivid colour. And if
the night follows, dark and haunted by grim
passions and sorrows, and the King’s Bench waits
for poor poets not far away, this poet who had
known the night and the prison only too well!
sang so undauntedly, that the terrors of them fell
away at the sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span></p>

<p>As he had this faith in the happy issue out of
his own troubles, so Dekker looked unflinchingly
as a poet upon the grim and dark side of human
life, seeing it to emerge presently, bright in the
higher vision of earth and Heaven. Much that at
first seems gratuitously obscene and terrible in his
dramatic presentation may in this way be accepted
with the same vigorous apprehension of the comedy
and tragedy of life, which he himself showed. The
whole justification of his lifework, indeed, is to be
found in these words of his, from the dedicatory
epistle to <i>His Dream</i>, which we may well take as
his parting behest:&mdash;“So in these of mine, though
the Devil be in the one, God is in the other: nay in
both. What I send you, may perhaps seem bitter,
yet it is wholesome; your best physic is not a
julep; sweet sauces leave rotten bodies. There is
a Hell named in our Creed, and a Heaven, and
the Hell comes before; if we look not into the first,
we shall never live in the last.”</p>

<h2>THE OLD FORTUNE THEATRE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>See <a href="#frontispiece">Frontispiece</a>.</i>)</p>


<p>The original Fortune Theatre was built on the site of an old timber
house standing in a large garden near Golden Lane, Cripplegate,
and said to have been formerly a nursery for Henry the Eighth’s
children, who were sent to this then suburban spot for the benefit of
the air. Edward Alleyn the actor acquired the lease of the house
and grounds on December 22, 1599, and, early the following year,
supported by the Lord Admiral (the Earl of Nottingham), to whose
company of players he belonged, he, in conjunction with Henslowe,
his father-in-law, employed Peter Streete to build there “a newe
house and stadge for a Plaiehowse” for the sum of £440.</p>

<p>Alleyn notes his acquisition of the lease and his expenditure upon
the new theatre in the following <span class="lock">terms:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What the Fortune cost me Novemb., 1599 [1600].</p>

<p>First for the leas to Brew, £240.</p>

<p>Then for the building the playhouse, £520.</p>

<p>For other privat buildings of myn owne, £120.</p>

<p>So in all it has cost me for the leasse, £880.</p>

<p>Bought the inheritance of the land of the Gills of the Ile of Man,
which is the Fortune, and all the howses in Whight crosstrett and
Gowlding lane, in June, 1610, for the some of £340.</p>

<p>Bought in John Garretts lease in revertion from the Gills for
21 years, for £100.</p>

<p>So in all itt cost me £1320.</p>

<p>Blessed be the Lord God everlasting.”</p></div>

<p>It was at the Fortune that Alleyn’s fame as an actor reached its
height. He was especially popular in the character of Barabas in
Marlowe’s <i>Jew of Malta</i>, which he revived at the new theatre.
Here also many of the plays written in the whole or part by Dekker
were originally performed, as Dekker generally wrote for the Lord
Admiral’s company, who played regularly at the Fortune under
Alleyn and Henslowe’s management, while the Lord Chamberlain’s
company, with whom Shakespeare and Burbadge were associated,
played at the Globe.</p>

<p>Some twenty years after the erection of the theatre Alleyn
records in his diary under date December 9, 1621, “This night, att
12 of ye clock, ye Fortune was burnt.” The year following the
theatre was rebuilt, and leased by Alleyn to various persons, he
having then decided to retire from the stage. On the suppression
of the theatres by the Puritans the inside of the Fortune was
destroyed by a company of soldiers, and the lessees failed to pay
their rent, whereby a considerable loss was sustained by the
authorities of Dulwich College, in whom the property of the
Fortune was vested. This eventually led to the Court of Assistants
ordering the more dilapidated portions of the theatre to be pulled
down, and to their leasing the ground belonging to it for building
purposes. So recently, however, as the year 1819, the front of the
old theatre was still standing, as represented in the frontispiece to
the present volume&mdash;a reduced copy of an engraving in Wilkinson’s
“Londina.”</p>

<p class="drop-capi2"><i><span class="smcap">The shoemaker’s holiday</span>, or a
Pleasant Comedy of the Gentle Craft</i>, was
first published in 1599, as we learn from a
passage in Henslowe’s Diary; but the
earliest known edition is the quarto of 1600,
which describes the play as “acted before
the Queen’s most excellent Maiestie New-years
day at night last, by the right honourable the
Earle of Nottingham, Lord High Admirall of England, his
seruants.” Other editions followed in 1610, 1618, and 1657.
Of modern editions, Germany has produced the only one
which is at all reliable, and upon this edition, admirably
collated and edited by Drs. Karl Warnke and Ludwig Proescholdt,
and published at Halle in 1886, the present reprint
is based, the excellence of text, notes and introduction,
leaving little beyond the modernising and some elucidation
here and there to be done.</p>

<p>Dekker appears to have had a collaborator in the play in
Robert Wilson, the actor, who is said to have created the
part of Firk on its performance, but although Wilson may
have provided some of the situations and dialogue, the
credit of the play as a whole is undoubtedly Dekker’s. <i>The
Shoemaker’s Holiday</i> is the first of Dekker’s plays, in order
of publication, which has survived, although according to
Henslowe he began to write for the stage in 1596.</p>

<p>The conception of Simon Eyre, the Shoemaker, is taken
from a real person of that name, who, according to Stow,
was an upholsterer, and afterwards a draper. He built
Leadenhall in 1419, as referred to by Dekker in Act V.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Sc. 5, became Sheriff of London in 1434, was elected Lord
Mayor in 1445, and died in 1459. About his character
nothing certain is known. “It may well be,” say the editors
of the Halle edition, “that long after Eyre’s death the builder
of Leadenhall was supposed to have been a shoemaker himself,
merely because Leadenhall was used as a leather-market.
This tradition was probably taken up by the poet,
who formed out of it one of the most popular comedies of
the age.”</p>

<p>Kind gentlemen and honest boon companions, I present
you here with a merry-conceited Comedy, called <i>The Shoemaker’s
Holiday</i>, acted by my Lord Admiral’s Players this
present Christmas before the Queen’s most excellent
Majesty, for the mirth and pleasant matter by her Highness
graciously accepted, being indeed no way offensive. The
argument of the play I will set down in this Epistle: Sir
Hugh Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, had a young gentleman of his
own name, his near kinsman, that loved the Lord Mayor’s
daughter of London; to prevent and cross which love, the
Earl caused his kinsman to be sent Colonel of a company
into France: who resigned his place to another gentleman
his friend, and came disguised like a Dutch shoemaker to
the house of Simon Eyre in Tower Street, who served the
Mayor and his household with shoes: the merriments that
passed in Eyre’s house, his coming to be Mayor of London,
Lacy’s getting his love, and other accidents, with two merry
Three-men’s-songs. Take all in good worth that is well
intended, for nothing is purposed but mirth; mirth lengtheneth
long life, which, with all other blessings, I heartily
wish you. Farewell!</p>

a trifle, a bauble, Hodge.</p>

<p><i>Hodge.</i> The truth is, Firk, that the merchant owner of
the ship dares not shew his head, and therefore this

offers my master Eyre a bargain in the commodities.
He shall have a reasonable day of payment; he may
sell the wares by that time, and be an huge gainer
himself.</p>

Move me not! Have not I ta’en you from selling tripes in
Eastcheap, and set you in my shop, and made you hail-fellow
with Simon Eyre, the shoemaker? And now do
you deal thus with my journeymen? Look, you powder-beef-quean,
on the face of Hodge, here’s a face for a
lord.</p>

<p><i>Firk.</i> And here’s a face for any lady in Christendom.</p>

<p><i>Eyre.</i> Rip, you chitterling, avaunt! Boy, bid the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>

<p><i>Firk.</i> A dozen cans? O, brave! Hodge, now I’ll stay.</p>

<p><i>Eyre.</i> (<i>In a low voice to the</i> Boy). An the knave fills
any more than two, he pays for them. (<i>Exit</i> Boy.

<p><i>Hodge.</i> I am a making a pair of shoes for my lord

I deal with her.</p>

<p><i>Eyre.</i> Sybil? Fie, defile not thy fine workmanly

Ladies of the court, fine ladies, my lads, commit their
feet to our apparelling; put gross work to Hans. Yark

<p><i>Firk.</i> Nay, dame, if my master prove not a lord, and
you a lady, hang me.</p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> Yea, like enough, if you may loiter and tipple thus.</p>

threadbare my garments. How dost thou like me,
Firk? How do I look, my fine Hodge?</p>

<p><i>Hodge.</i> Why, now you look like yourself, master. I
warrant you, there’s few in the city, but will give you the
wall, and come upon you with the right worshipful.</p>

<p><i>Firk.</i> Nails, my master looks like a threadbare cloak
new turned and dressed. Lord, Lord, to see what good
raiment doth! Dame, dame, are you not enamoured?</p>

<p><i>Eyre.</i> How say’st thou, Maggy, am I not brisk? Am
I not fine?</p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> Fine? By my troth, sweetheart, very fine! By
my troth, I never liked thee so well in my life, sweetheart;
but let that pass. I warrant, there be many women in the
city have not such handsome husbands, but only for their

<p><i>Firk.</i> Ay, forsooth.</p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> I pray thee, run&mdash;do you hear?&mdash;run to Guildhall,
and learn if my husband, Master Eyre, will take
that worshipful vocation of Master Sheriff upon him.
Hie thee, good Firk.</p>

<p><i>Firk.</i> Take it? Well, I go; an’ he should not take it,
Firk swears to forswear him. Yes, forsooth, I go to
Guildhall.</p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> Nay, when? thou art too compendious and
tedious.</p>

<p><i>Firk.</i> O rare, your excellence is full of eloquence;
how like a new cart-wheel my dame speaks, and she
looks like an old musty ale-bottle<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> going to scalding.</p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> Let me see now, Roger and Hans.</p>

<p><i>Hodge.</i> Ay, forsooth, dame&mdash;mistress I should say, but
the old term so sticks to the roof of my mouth, I can
hardly lick it off.</p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> Even what thou wilt, good Roger; dame is a
fair name for any honest Christian; but let that pass.
How dost thou, Hans?</p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> Well, Hans and Roger, you see, God hath
blest your master, and, perdy, if ever he comes to be
Master Sheriff of London&mdash;as we are all mortal&mdash;you
shall see, I will have some odd thing or other in a corner
for you: I will not be your back-friend; but let that
pass. Hans, pray thee, tie my shoe.</p>

is none of the biggest, so I thank God, it is handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
enough; prithee, let me have a pair of shoes made, cork,
good Roger, wooden heel too.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p><i>Hodge.</i> You shall.</p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> Art thou acquainted with never a farthingale-maker,

Perdy,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> oddly, I think.</p>

<p><i>Hodge.</i> As a cat out of a pillory:<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> very well, I warrant
you, mistress.</p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> Indeed, all flesh is grass; and, Roger, canst
thou tell where I may buy a good hair?</p>

<p><i>Hodge.</i> Yes, forsooth, at the poulterer’s in Gracious
Street.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> Thou art an ungracious wag; perdy, I mean a
false hair for my periwig.</p>

<p><i>Hodge.</i> Why, mistress, the next time I cut my beard, you
shall have the shavings of it; but they are all true hairs.</p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> It is very hot, I must get me a fan or else a
mask.</p>

<p><i>Hodge.</i> So you had need to hide your wicked face.</p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> Fie, upon it, how costly this world’s calling is;
perdy, but that it is one of the wonderful works of God,
I would not deal with it. Is not Firk come yet? Hans,
be not so sad, let it pass and vanish, as my husband’s
worship says.</p>

<p><i>Hodge.</i> Mistress, will you drink a pipe of tobacco?</p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> Oh, fie upon it, Roger, perdy! These filthy
tobacco-pipes are the most idle slavering baubles that
ever I felt. Out upon it! God bless us, men look not
like men that use them.</p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> Trust me, I am sorry, Ralph, to see thee impotent.
Lord, how the wars have made him sunburnt!
The left leg is not well; ’twas a fair gift of God the infirmity
took not hold a little higher, considering thou
camest from France; but let that pass.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Ralph.</i> I am glad to see you well, and I rejoice<br /></span>

<p><i>Marg.</i> Yea, truly, Ralph, I thank my Maker; but let
that pass.</p>

<p><i>Hodge.</i> And, sirrah Ralph, what news, what news in
France?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Tell me, good Roger, first, what news in
England? How does my Jane? When didst thou see
my wife?</p>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where lives my poor heart? She’ll be poor indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now I want limbs to get whereon to feed.<br /></span>

shalt never see a shoemaker want bread, though he have
but three fingers on a hand.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Yet all this while I hear not of my Jane.</p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> O Ralph, your wife,&mdash;perdy, we know not
what’s become of her. She was here a while, and because
she was married, grew more stately than became her; I
checked her, and so forth; away she flung, never returned,
nor said bye nor bah; and, Ralph, you know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
“ka me, ka thee.”<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> And so, as I tell ye&mdash;&mdash;Roger, is
not Firk come yet?</p>

<p><i>Hodge.</i> No, forsooth.</p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> And so, indeed, we heard not of her, but I hear
she lives in London; but let that pass. If she had
wanted, she might have opened her case to me or my
husband, or to any of my men; I am sure, there’s not
any of them, perdy, but would have done her good to
his power. Hans, look if Firk be come.</p>

<p><i>Hans.</i> <i>Yaw, ik sal, vro.</i><a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>      <span class="rightdirection">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Hans</span>.</span></p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> And so, as I said&mdash;but, Ralph, why dost thou
weep? Thou knowest that naked we came out of our
mother’s womb, and naked we must return; and, therefore,
thank God for all things.</p>

<p><i>Hodge.</i> No, faith, Jane is a stranger here; but, Ralph,
pull up a good heart, I know thou hast one. Thy wife,
man, is in London; one told me, he saw her a while ago
very brave and neat; we’ll ferret her out, an’ London hold
her.</p>

<p><i>Marg.</i> Alas, poor soul, he’s overcome with sorrow; he
does but as I do, weep for the loss of any good thing.
But, Ralph, get thee in, call for some meat and drink,
thou shalt find me worshipful towards thee.</p>

I must after. Come, Madge, on with your trinkets!
Now, my true Trojans, my fine Firk, my dapper Hodge,
my honest Hans, some device, some odd crotchets, some
morris, or such like, for the honour of the gentlemen
shoemakers. Meet me at Old Ford, you know my mind.
Come, Madge, away. Shut up the shop, knaves, and
make holiday.      <span class="rightdirection">[<i>Exeunt.</i></span></p>

gentleman grocer like my lord mayor, your father; a
grocer is a sweet trade: plums, plums. Had I a son or

Are you sure, sir, by this?</p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> How, by this? Am I sure, by this? Art thou

thou do’t?</p>

this shoe, I can do’t. Four a clock, well. Whither shall
I bring them?</p>

my master.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Yea, sir; by this shoe, you say?</p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> I say, Master Hammon at the Golden Ball;
he’s the bridegroom, and those shoes are for his bride.</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> They shall be done by this shoe; well, well,
Master Hammon at the Golden Shoe&mdash;I would say, the

Fear nothing, Rose: let them all say what they can;

Fie, I scorn it, it shall never be cast in my teeth, that I
was unthankful. Lady Madgy, thou had’st never covered
thy Saracen’s head with this French flap, nor loaden thy
bum with this farthingale, (’tis trash, trumpery, vanity);
Simon Eyre had never walked in a red petticoat, nor
wore a chain of gold, but for my fine journeyman’s Portuguese.&mdash;And

Lord of Ludgate, it’s a mad life to be a lord mayor; it’s
a stirring life, a fine life, a velvet life, a careful life.
Well, Simon Eyre, yet set a good face on it, in the
honour of Saint Hugh. Soft, the king this day comes to
dine with me, to see my new buildings; his majesty is
welcome, he shall have good cheer, delicate cheer,
princely cheer. This day, my fellow prentices of London
come to dine with me too, they shall have fine cheer,
gentlemanlike cheer. I promised the mad Cappadocians,
when we all served at the Conduit together, that if ever I
came to be mayor of London, I would feast them all, and
I’ll do’t, I’ll do’t, by the life of Pharaoh; by this beard,
Sim Eyre will be no flincher. Besides, I have procured
that upon every Shrove-Tuesday, at the sound of the
pancake bell, my fine dapper Assyrian lads shall clap up
their shop windows, and away. This is the day, and this

<p><i>Hodge.</i> Come, Ralph; stand to it, Firk. My masters,
as we are the brave bloods of the shoemakers, heirs apparent
to Saint Hugh, and perpetual benefactors to all
good fellows, thou shalt have no wrong; were Hammon
a king of spades, he should not delve in thy close without
thy sufferance. But tell me, Ralph, art thou sure ’tis
thy wife?</p>

<p><i>Ralph.</i> Am I sure this is Firk? This morning, when
I stroked<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> on her shoes, I looked upon her, and she upon
me, and sighed, asked me if ever I knew one Ralph.
Yes, said I. For his sake, said she&mdash;tears standing in
her eyes&mdash;and for thou art somewhat like him, spend this
piece of gold. I took it; my lame leg and my travel beyond
sea made me unknown. All is one for that: I
know she’s mine.</p>

<p><i>Firk.</i> Did she give thee this gold? O glorious glittering
gold! She’s thine own, ’tis thy wife, and she loves
thee; for I’ll stand to’t, there’s no woman will give gold
to any man, but she thinks better of him, than she thinks
of them she gives silver to. And for Hammon, neither
Hammon nor hangman shall wrong thee in London. Is
not our old master Eyre, lord mayor? Speak, my hearts.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Yes, and Hammon shall know it to his cost.</p>

Good-morrow, Jane, how dost thou? Good Lord, how
the world is changed with you! God be thanked!</p>

<p><i>Hodge.</i> Hold, my hearts! Touch her, Hammon?
Yea, and more than that: we’ll carry her away with us.
My masters and gentlemen, never draw your bird-spits;
shoemakers are steel to the back, men every inch of
them, all spirit.</p>

<p><i>Those of Hammon’s side.</i> Well, and what of all this?</p>

<p><i>Hodge.</i> I’ll show you.&mdash;Jane, dost thou know this man?
’Tis Ralph, I can tell thee; nay, ’tis he in faith, though
he be lamed by the wars. Yet look not strange, but run
to him, fold him about the neck and kiss him.</p>

you see not a white hair on my head, not a gray in this
beard. Every hair, I assure thy majesty, that sticks in
this beard, Sim Eyre values at the King of Babylon’s
ransom, Tamar Cham’s<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> beard was a rubbing brush to’t:
yet I’ll shave it off, and stuff tennis-balls with it, to please
my bully king.</p>

<p><i>King.</i> But all this while I do not know your age.</p>

<p><i>Eyre.</i> My liege, I am six and fifty year old, yet I can
cry humph! with a sound heart for the honour of Saint
Hugh. Mark this old wench, my king: I danced the
shaking of the sheets with her six and thirty years
ago, and yet I hope to get two or three young lord
mayors, ere I die. I am lusty still, Sim Eyre still. Care
and cold lodging brings white hairs. My sweet Majesty,
let care vanish, cast it upon thy nobles, it will make thee
look always young like Apollo, and cry humph! Prince
am I none, yet am I princely born.</p>

<p class="drop-capi2"><span class="smcap">Between</span> the publication of the first,
and of the second, parts of <i>The Honest
Whore</i>, a quarter of a century passed.
The first part appeared in 1604, having
the sub-title “With the Humours of the
Patient Man, and the Longing Wife.”
In 1630 followed the second part, in
which the sub-title is further expanded:&mdash;“With
the Humours of the Patient Man, the Impatient
Wife: the Honest Whore, persuaded by strong arguments to
turne Courtesan again: her brave refuting those Arguments.&mdash;And
lastly, the Comical Passages of an Italian Bridewell,
where the scene ends.” Both title-pages give Dekker’s name
alone as author, although from a passage in Henslow’s Diary,
we learn that Middleton collaborated with him in the play.</p>

<p>It is impossible now to decide exactly what Middleton’s
share was, but it was certainly not inconsiderable. Mr. Bullen
points out, in his introduction to Middleton’s works, the close
resemblance between the scene where Bellafront prepares
for her visitors, and the first scene in the 3rd Act of Middleton’s
<i>Michaelmas Term</i>; but this play did not appear until
three years after the first part of Dekker’s. Still the fact of
Middleton’s repeating the scene, goes to show that he had
some special share in it, and certain other scenes in the first
part are somewhat reminiscent of his style, as those in Acts I.
and III., indicated by Mr. Bullen, where the gallants try to
irritate Candido. The second part contains nothing that I
should be inclined to allot to Middleton, agreeing in this
with Mr. Swinburne, who remarks that it “seems so
thoroughly of one piece and pattern, so apparently the result
of one man’s invention and composition, that without more
positive evidence I should hesitate to assign a share in it to
any colleague of the poet under whose name it first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
appeared.” Mr. J. Addington Symonds has conjectured
that the work as a whole has “the movement of one of
Middleton’s acknowledged plays,” and it is possible that the
main direction of the plot may have owed something to his
more restraining dramatic sense of form. However this may
be, the essential heart and spirit of the play are Dekker’s
beyond all question. Bellafront, Matheo, Friscobaldo,
Candido, are creatures not to be mistaken; and their interplay
is managed throughout in Dekker’s individual manner.
The source whence these, with the rest of the characters and
episodes of the play, have been derived, has not been discovered:
they were no doubt transcribed from life, and their
secret lies hidden probably in Dekker’s brain alone.</p>

<img src="images/zillt091a.png" width="400" height="36" alt="decoration" />

<p>“There is in the second part of <i>The Honest Whore</i>,
where Bellafront, a reclaimed harlot, recounts some of the
miseries of her profession, a simple picture of honour and
shame, contrasted without violence, and expressed without
immodesty, which is worth all the <i>strong lines</i> against the
harlot’s profession, with which both parts of this play are
offensively crowded. A satirist is always to be suspected,
who, to make vice odious, dwells upon all its acts and
minutest circumstances with a sort of relish and retrospective
fondness. But so near are the boundaries of panegyric and
invective, that a worn-out sinner is sometimes found to make
the best declaimer against sin. The same high-seasoned
descriptions, which in his unregenerate state served but to
inflame his appetites, in his new province of a moralist will
serve him, a little turned, to expose the enormity of those
appetites in other men.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. Lamb</span>: <i>Specimens of English

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>Another Street.</i></h4>

<p class="indentdirection"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Fustigo</span> <i>in some fantastic Sea-suit, meeting a

<p><i>Fus.</i> How now, porter, will she come?</p>

<p><i>Por.</i> If I may trust a woman, sir, she will come.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> There’s for thy pains [<i>Gives money</i>]. Godamercy,
if ever I stand in need of a wench that will come with a
wet finger,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> porter, thou shalt earn my money before any
clarissimo<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> in Milan; yet, so God sa’ me, she’s mine own
sister body and soul, as I am a Christian gentleman;
farewell; I’ll ponder till she come: thou hast been no
bawd in fetching this woman, I assure thee.</p>

<p><i>Por.</i> No matter if I had, sir, better men than porters
are bawds.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> O God, sir, many that have borne offices. But,
porter, art sure thou went’st into a true house?</p>

<p><i>Por.</i> I think so, for I met with no thieves.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> Nay, but art sure it was my sister, Viola.</p>

<p><i>Por.</i> I am sure, by all superscriptions, it was the party
you ciphered.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> Not very tall?</p>

<p><i>Por.</i> Nor very low; a middling woman.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> ’Twas she, ’faith, ’twas she, a pretty plump cheek,
like mine?</p>

<p><i>Por.</i> At a blush a little, very much like you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> Godso, I would not for a ducat she had
kicked up her heels, for I ha’ spent an abomination this
voyage, marry, I did it amongst sailors and gentlemen.
There’s a little modicum more, porter, for making thee
stay [<i>Gives money</i>]; farewell, honest porter.</p>

<p><i>Por.</i> I am in your debt, sir; God preserve you.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> Not so, neither, good porter. [<i>Exit</i> Porter.]
God’s lid, yonder she comes. [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Viola</span>.] Sister
Viola, I am glad to see you stirring: it’s news to have
me here, is’t not, sister?</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> Yes, trust me; I wondered who should be so
bold to send for me: you are welcome to Milan,
brother.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> Troth, sister, I heard you were married to a very
rich chuff,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> and I was very sorry for it, that I had no
better clothes, and that made me send; for you know we
Milaners love to strut upon Spanish leather. And how do
all our friends?</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> Very well; you ha’ travelled enough now, I
trow, to sow your wild oats.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> A pox on ’em! wild oats? I ha’ not an oat to
throw at a horse. Troth, sister, I ha’ sowed my oats, and
reaped two hundred ducats if I had ’em here. Marry, I
must entreat you to lend me some thirty or forty till the
ship come: by this hand, I’ll discharge at my day, by
this hand.</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> These are your old oaths.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> Why, sister, do you think I’ll forswear my hand?</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> Well, well, you shall have them: put yourself into
better fashion, because I must employ you in a serious
matter.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> I’ll sweat like a horse if I like the matter.</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> You ha’ cast off all your old swaggering humours?</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> I had not sailed a league in that great fishpond,
the sea, but I cast up my very gall.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Vio.</i> I am the more sorry, for I must employ a true
swaggerer.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> Nay by this iron, sister, they shall find I am
powder and touch-box, if they put fire once into me.</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> Then lend me your ears.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> Mine ears are yours, dear sister.</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> I am married to a man that has wealth enough,
and wit enough.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> A linen-draper, I was told, sister.</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> Very true, a grave citizen, I want nothing that a
wife can wish from a husband: but here’s the spite, he
has not all the things belonging to a man.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> God’s my life, he’s a very mandrake,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> or else (God
bless us) one a’ these whiblins,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> and that’s worse, and
then all the children that he gets lawfully of your body,
sister, are bastards by a statute.</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> O, you run over me too fast, brother; I have
heard it often said, that he who cannot be angry is no
man. I am sure my husband is a man in print, for all
things else save only in this, no tempest can move him.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> ’Slid, would he had been at sea with us! he
should ha’ been moved, and moved again, for I’ll be
sworn, la, our drunken ship reeled like a Dutchman.</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> No loss of goods can increase in him a wrinkle,
no crabbed language make his countenance sour, the
stubbornness of no servant shake him; he has no more
gall in him than a dove, no more sting than an ant;
musician will he never be, yet I find much music in him,
but he loves no frets, and is so free from anger, that many
times I am ready to bite off my tongue, because it
wants that virtue which all women’s tongues have, to
anger their husbands: brother, mine can by no thunder,
turn him into a sharpness.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> Belike his blood, sister, is well brewed then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> I protest to thee, Fustigo, I love him most
affectionately; but I know not&mdash;I ha’ such a tickling
within me&mdash;such a strange longing; nay, verily I do long.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> Then you’re with child, sister, by all signs and
tokens; nay, I am partly a physician, and partly something
else. I ha’ read Albertus Magnus, and Aristotle’s
Problems.</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> You’re wide a’ th’ bow hand<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> still, brother: my
longings are not wanton, but wayward: I long to have
my patient husband eat up a whole porcupine, to the
intent, the bristling quills may stick about his lips like a
Flemish mustachio, and be shot at me: I shall be leaner
the new moon, unless I can make him horn-mad.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> ’Sfoot, half a quarter of an hour does that; make
him a cuckold.</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> Pooh, he would count such a cut no unkindness.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> The honester citizen he; then make him drunk
and cut off his beard.</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> Fie, fie, idle, idle! he’s no Frenchman, to fret at
the loss of a little scald<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> hair. No, brother, thus it shall
be&mdash;you must be secret.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> As your mid-wife, I protest, sister, or a barber-surgeon.</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> Repair to the Tortoise here in St. Christopher’s
Street; I will send you money; turn yourself into a brave
man: instead of the arms of your mistress, let your sword
and your military scarf hang about your neck.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> I must have a great horseman’s French feather
too, sister.</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> O, by any means, to show your light head, else
your hat will sit like a coxcomb: to be brief, you must be
in all points a most terrible wide-mouthed swaggerer.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> Nay, for swaggering points let me alone.</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> Resort then to our shop, and, in my husband’s
presence, kiss me, snatch rings, jewels, or any thing, so
you give it back again, brother, in secret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> By this hand, sister.</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> Swear as if you came but new from knighting.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> Nay, I’ll swear after four-hundred a year.</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> Swagger worse than a lieutenant among fresh-water
soldiers, call me your love, your ingle,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> your cousin,
or so; but sister at no hand.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> No, no, it shall be cousin, or rather coz; that’s
the gulling word between the citizens’ wives and their
mad-caps that man ’em to the garden; to call you one a’
mine aunts’<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> sister, were as good as call you arrant whore;
no, no, let me alone to cousin you rarely.</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> H’as heard I have a brother, but never saw him,
therefore put on a good face.</p>

<h4>SCENE IV.&mdash;<i>A Street.</i></h4>

<p class="indentdirection"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Castruchio</span>, <span class="smcap">Pioratto</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fluello</span>.</p>


<p><i>Cas.</i> Signor Pioratto, Signor Fluello, shall’s be merry?
shall’s play the wags now?</p>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Flu.</i> Ay, any thing that may beget the child of laughter.<br /></span>
</div>

<p><i>Cas.</i> Truth, I have a pretty sportive conceit new crept
into my brain, will move excellent mirth.</p>

<p><i>Pio.</i> Let’s ha’t, let’s ha’t; and where shall the scene
of mirth lie?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cas.</i> At Signor Candido’s house, the patient man, nay,
the monstrous patient man; they say his blood is immoveable,
that he has taken all patience from a man,
and all constancy from a woman.</p>

<p><i>Flu.</i> That makes so many whores now-a-days.</p>

<p><i>Cas.</i> Ay, and so many knaves too.</p>

<p><i>Pio.</i> Well, sir.</p>

<p><i>Cas.</i> To conclude, the report goes, he’s so mild, so
affable, so suffering, that nothing indeed can move him:
now do but think what sport it will be to make this
fellow, the mirror of patience, as angry, as vexed, and as
mad as an English cuckold.</p>

<p><i>Flu.</i> O, ’twere admirable mirth, that: but how will’t
be done, signor?</p>

<p><i>Cas.</i> Let me alone, I have a trick, a conceit, a thing,
a device will sting him i’faith, if he have but a thimbleful
of blood in’s belly, or a spleen not so big as a tavern
token.</p>

<p><i>Pio.</i> Thou stir him? thou move him? thou anger
him? alas, I know his approved temper: thou vex
him? why he has a patience above man’s injuries:
thou may’st sooner raise a spleen in an angel, than
rough humour in him. Why I’ll give you instance for
it. This wonderfully tempered Signor Candido upon a
time invited home to his house certain Neapolitan lords,
of curious taste, and no mean palates, conjuring his wife,
of all loves,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> to prepare cheer fitting for such honourable
trencher-men. She&mdash;just of a woman’s nature, covetous
to try the uttermost of vexation, and thinking at last to
get the start of his humour&mdash;willingly neglected the
preparation, and became unfurnished, not only of dainty,
but of ordinary dishes. He, according to the mildness
of his breast, entertained the lords, and with courtly
discourse beguiled the time, as much as a citizen might
do. To conclude, they were hungry lords, for there
came no meat in; their stomachs were plainly gulled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
and their teeth deluded, and, if anger could have seized
a man, there was matter enough i’faith to vex any citizen
in the world, if he were not too much made a fool by his
wife.</p>

<p><i>Flu.</i> Ay, I’ll swear for’t: ’sfoot, had it been my case,
I should ha’ played mad tricks with my wife and family:
first, I would ha’ spitted the men, stewed the maids, and
baked the mistress, and so served them in.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Pio.</i> Why ’twould ha’ tempted any blood but his,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou to vex him? thou to anger him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With some poor shallow jest?<br /></span>
</div>

<p><i>Cas.</i> ’Sblood, Signor Pioratto, you that disparage my
conceit, I’ll wage a hundred ducats upon the head on’t,
that it moves him, frets him, and galls him.</p>

<p><i>Pio.</i> Done, ’tis a lay,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> join golls<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> on’t: witness Signor
Fluello.</p>

<span class="i0">Come, follow me: the house is not far off,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’ll thrust him from his humour, vex his breast,<br /></span>

<p><i>Cas.</i> Fellow, let’s see a lawn, a choice one, sirrah.</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> The best in all Milan, gentlemen, and this is the

doublets, the only sweet fashion now, most delicate and
courtly, a meek gentle calico, cut upon two double affable
taffetas,&mdash;ah, most neat, feat, and unmatchable!</p>

<p><i>Flu.</i> A notable voluble-tongued villain.</p>

<p><i>Pio.</i> I warrant this fellow was never begot without
much prating.</p>

<p><i>Cas.</i> What, and is this she, sayest thou?</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> Ay, and the purest she that ever you fingered
since you were a gentleman: look how even she is, look
how clean she is, ha! as even as the brow of Cynthia,
and as clean as your sons and heirs when they ha’
spent all.</p>

<p><i>Cas.</i> Pooh, thou talkest&mdash;pox on’t, ’tis rough.</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> How? is she rough? but if you bid pox on’t, sir,
’twill take away the roughness presently.</p>

<p><i>Flu.</i> Ha, signor; has he fitted your French curse?</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> Look you, gentlemen, here’s another, compare
them I pray, <i>compara Virgilium cum Homero</i>, compare
virgins with harlots.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Cas.</i> Pooh, I ha’ seen better, and as you term them,

<p><i>Geo.</i> You may see further for your mind, but trust me,
you shall not find better for your body.</p>

Come, come, we’ll try in some other shop.</p>

<p><i>Cas.</i> Why, in good troth, if you’ll trust me, acquaintance,

sweet Oliver will eat mutton till he be ready to burst, but
the lean-jawed slave will not pay for the scraping of his

him not touch a bit, till every one has had his full cut.</p>

what a vile woman is this! twenty pound a-night, I’ll be
sworn, Roger, in good gold and no silver: why here was
a time! if she should ha’ picked out a time, it could not
be better: gold enough stirring; choice of men, choice
of hair, choice of beards, choice of legs, and choice of
every, every, everything: it cannot sink into my head,
that she should be such an ass. Roger, I never

five, six, seven, eight and nine; by this hand bring me

I’ll lurk in a tavern not far off, and provide supper to
close up the end of the tragedy: the linen-draper’s,

parts perfectly.</p>

<p><i>Cram.</i> Look you, signor, ’tis not your gold that we

pheasants, plovers, an orangeado-pie, or so: but how
bloody howsoe’er the day be, sally you not forth.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> No, no; nay if I stir, some body shall stink: I’ll
not budge: I’ll lie like a dog in a manger.</p>

<p><i>Cram.</i> Well, well, to the tavern, let not our supper be
raw, for you shall have blood enough, your bellyful.</p>

<p><i>Fus.</i> That’s all, so God sa’ me, I thirst after; blood

neither hum, hem, nor ha; only stared me in the

<p><i>Vio.</i> I thank you, sir. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Pioratto</span>.] George,
are there many mad folks where thy master lies?</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> Oh yes, of all countries some; but especially
mad Greeks, they swarm. Troth mistress, the world is
altered with you; you had not wont to stand thus with
a paper humbly complaining: but you’re well enough
served: provender pricked you, as it does many of our
city wives besides.</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> Dost think, George, we shall get him forth?</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> Truly, mistress, I cannot tell; I think you’ll
hardly get him forth. Why, ’tis strange! ’Sfoot, I have
known many women that have had mad rascals to their
husbands, whom they would belabour by all means
possible to keep ’em in their right wits, but of a woman
to long to turn a tame man into a madman, why the
devil himself was never used so by his dam.</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> Afraid! you had more need be ashamed, he may
rather be afraid of you.</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> But, George, he’s not stark mad, is he? he does
not rave, he is not horn-mad, George, is he?</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> Nay I know not that, but he talks like a justice
of peace, of a thousand matters, and to no purpose.</p>

<p><i>Vio.</i> I’ll to the monastery: I shall be mad till I enjoy
him, I shall be sick until I see him; yet when I do see
him, I shall weep out mine eyes.</p>

<p><i>Geo.</i> I’d fain see a woman weep out her eyes, that’s
as true as to say, a man’s cloak burns, when it hangs in
the water: I know you’ll weep, mistress, but what says
the painted cloth?<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

</div>

<p><i>Pio.</i> Sirrah, are all the mad folks in Milan brought
hither?</p>

<p><i>Sweep.</i> How, all? there’s a question indeed: why if
all the mad folks in Milan should come hither, there
would not be left ten men in the city.</p>

<p><i>Duke.</i> Few gentlemen or courtiers here, ha?</p>

<p><i>Sweep.</i> O yes, abundance, abundance! lands no sooner
fall into their hands, but straight they run out a’ their
wits: citizens’ sons and heirs are free of the house by
their fathers’ copy. Farmers’ sons come hither like
geese, in flocks, and when they ha’ sold all their corn-fields,
here they sit and pick the straws.</p>

<p><i>Sin.</i> Methinks you should have women here as well as
men.</p>

’em; they’re madder than March hares.</p>

<p><i>Flu.</i> Are there no lawyers amongst you?</p>

<p><i>Sweep.</i> Oh no, not one; never any lawyer, we dare
not let a lawyer come in, for he’ll make ’em mad faster
than we can recover ’em.</p>

<p><i>Duke.</i> And how long is’t ere you recover any of
these?</p>

<p><i>Sweep.</i> Why, according to the quantity of the moon
that’s got into ’em. An alderman’s son will be mad
a great while, a very great while, especially if his friends
left him well; a whore will hardly come to her wits
again: a puritan, there’s no hope of him, unless he may
pull down the steeple, and hang himself i’ th’ bell-ropes.</p>

<p><i>Flu.</i> I perceive all sorts of fish come to your net.</p>

at the citizen, the citizen is mad at the countryman; the
shoemaker is mad at the cobbler, the cobbler at the car-man;
the punk is mad that the merchant’s wife is no
whore, the merchant’s wife is mad that the punk is so

crickets to the crevice of a brew-house; but sir, in England

<p><i>Lod.</i> In England, sir,&mdash;troth, I ever laugh when I think
on’t: to see a whole nation should be marked i’th’ forehead,

costermongers are Irishmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ast.</i>, <i>Ber.</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> Good, good! ha, ha!</p>

<p><i>Lod.</i> Why, then, should all your chimney-sweepers

<p><i>Car.</i> Faith, that’s soon answered, for St. Patrick, you
know, keeps purgatory; he makes the fire, and his countrymen
could do nothing, if they cannot sweep the
chimneys.</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i>, <i>Ber.</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> Good again.</p>

sugarest, delicious rogues!</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> Oh, look, he has a feeling of them!</p>

<p><i>Lod.</i> Not I, I protest. There’s a saying when they
commend nations. It goes, the Irishman for his hand,
the Welshman for a leg, the Englishman for a face, the
Dutchman for a beard.</p>

<p><i>Fon.</i> I’faith, they may make swabbers of them.</p>

but she has been more common than tobacco: this is she
that had the name of the Honest Whore.</p>

<p><i>Lod.</i> Godso’, gentlemen, what do we forget?</p>

<p><i>Car.</i>, <i>Ast.</i>, <i>Ber.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Lod.</i> Are not we all enjoined as this day.&mdash;Thursday
is’t not? Ay, as this day to be at the linen-draper’s
house at dinner?</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Signor Candido, the patient man.</p>

<p><i>Ast.</i> Afore Jove, true, upon this day he’s married.</p>

<p><i>Ber.</i> I wonder, that being so stung with a wasp before,
he dares venture again to come about the eaves amongst
bees.</p>

<p><i>Lod.</i> Oh ’tis rare sucking a sweet honey comb! pray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Heaven his old wife be buried deep enough, that she rise
not up to call for her dance! The poor fiddlers’ instruments
would crack for it, she’d tickle them. At any hand
let’s try what mettle is in his new bride; if there be
none, we’ll put in some. Troth, it’s a very noble citizen, I
pity he should marry again; I’ll walk along, for it is a
good old fellow.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> I warrant the wives of Milan would give any
fellow twenty thousand ducats, that could but have the
face to beg of the duke, that all the citizens in Milan
might be bound to the peace of patience, as the linen-draper
is.</p>

we should have no whoop! with the wenches then.</p>

Hippolito.      <span class="rightdirection">[<i>Exeunt all but</i> <span class="smcap">Hippolito</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Friscobaldo</span>.</span></p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> My noble lord: my Lord Hippolito! the duke’s
son! his brave daughter’s brave husband! how does your
honoured lordship! does your nobility remember so poor a
gentleman as Signor Orlando Friscobaldo! old mad
Orlando!</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Oh, sir, our friends! they ought to be unto us as
our jewels, as dearly valued, being locked up, and
unseen, as when we wear them in our hands. I see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
Friscobaldo, age hath not command of your blood, for
all Time’s sickle has gone over you, you are Orlando still.</p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> Why, my lord, are not the fields mown and cut
down, and stripped bare, and yet wear they not pied
coats again? Though my head be like a leek, white,
may not my heart be like the blade, green?</p>

<div class="stanza">

<p>My heart shall never have a wrinkle in it, so long as I
can cry “Hem,” with a clear voice.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> You are the happier man, sir.</p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> Happy man? I’ll give you, my lord, the true
picture of a happy man; I was turning leaves over this
morning, and found it; an excellent Italian painter drew
it; if I have it in the right colours, I’ll bestow it on your
lordship.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> I stay for it.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Orl.</i> He that makes gold his wife, but not his whore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He that at noon-day walks by a prison door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He that i’th’ sun is neither beam nor mote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He that’s not mad after a petticoat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He for whom poor men’s curses dig no grave,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He that upon his deathbed is a swan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dead, no crow&mdash;he is a happy man.<br /></span>
</div>

<p><i>Hip.</i> It’s very well; I thank you for this picture.</p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> After this picture, my lord, do I strive to have
my face drawn: for I am not covetous, am not in debt;
sit neither at the duke’s side, nor lie at his feet. Wenching
and I have done; no man I wrong, no man I fear, no
man I fee; I take heed how far I walk, because I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
yonder’s my home; I would not die like a rich man, to
carry nothing away save a winding sheet: but like a good
man, to leave Orlando behind me. I sowed leaves in my
youth, and I reap now books in my age. I fill this hand,
and empty this; and when the bell shall toll for me, if I
prove a swan, and go singing to my nest, why so! If a
crow! throw me out for carrion, and pick out mine eyes.
May not old Friscobaldo, my lord, be merry now! ha?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> You may; would I were partner in your mirth.</p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> I have a little, have all things. I have nothing;
I have no wife, I have no child, have no chick; and why
should not I be in my jocundare?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Is your wife then departed?</p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> She’s an old dweller in those high countries, yet
not from me. Here, she’s here: but before me, when a
knave and a quean are married, they commonly walk like
serjeants together: but a good couple are seldom parted.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> You had a daughter too, sir, had you not?</p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> O my lord! this old tree had one branch, and but
one branch growing out of it. It was young, it was fair,
it was straight; I pruned it daily, dressed it carefully,
kept it from the wind, helped it to the sun, yet for all my
skill in planting, it grew crooked, it bore crabs; I hewed
it down; what’s become of it, I neither know, nor care.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Hip.</i> Then I can tell you what’s become of it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That branch is withered.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Orl.</i> So ’twas long ago.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Hip.</i> Her name I think was Bellafront, she’s dead.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Orl.</i> Ha? dead?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Hip.</i> Yes; what of her was left, not worth the keeping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even in my sight was thrown into a grave.<br /></span>
</div>

<p><i>Orl.</i> Dead! my last and best peace go with her! I
see Death’s a good trencherman, he can eat coarse
homely meat, as well as the daintiest.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Why, Friscobaldo, was she homely?</p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> O my lord! a strumpet is one of the devil’s vines;
all the sins, like so many poles, are stuck upright out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
hell, to be her props, that she may spread upon them.
And when she’s ripe, every slave has a pull at her, then
must she be pressed. The young beautiful grape sets the
teeth of lust on edge, yet to taste that liquorish wine, is to
drink a man’s own damnation. Is she dead?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> She’s turned to earth.</p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> Would she were turned to Heaven! Umph, is she
dead? I am glad the world has lost one of his idols; no
whoremonger will at midnight beat at the doors. In her
grave sleep all my shame, and her own; and all my
sorrows, and all her sins!</p>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Hip.</i> I’m glad you’re wax, not marble; you are made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of man’s best temper; there are now good hopes<br /></span>

<p><i>Orl.</i> In my daughter, you will say! does she live then?
I am sorry I wasted tears upon a harlot; but the best is
I have a handkercher to drink them up, soap can wash
them all out again. Is she poor?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Trust me, I think she is.</p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> Then she’s a right strumpet; I ne’er knew any of
their trade rich two years together; sieves can hold no
water, nor harlots hoard up money; they have too many
vents, too many sluices to let it out; taverns, tailors,
bawds, panders, fiddlers, swaggerers, fools and knaves do
all wait upon a common harlot’s trencher: she is the gallipot
to which these drones fly, not for love to the pot,
but for the sweet sucket<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> within it, her money, her money.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Is your hate so old?</p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> Older; it has a white head, and shall never die
till she be buried: her wrongs shall be my bedfellow.</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> Work yet his life, since in it lives her fame.</p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> No, let him hang, and half her infamy departs
out of the world: I hate him for her; he taught her first
to taste poison; I hate her for herself, because she
refused my physic.</p>

her own by inheritance, and left to her by her mother.
There’s a lord now that goes about not to take it clean
from her, but to enclose it to himself, and to join it to a
piece of his lordship’s.</p>

<p><i>Inf.</i> What would she have me do in this?</p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> No more, madam, but what one woman should
do for another in such a case. My honourable lord
your husband, would do any thing in her behalf, but she
had rather put herself into your hands, because you, a
woman, may do more with the duke, your father.</p>

<p><i>Inf.</i> Where lies this land?</p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> Within a stone’s cast of this place; my mistress,
I think, would be content to let him enjoy it after her
decease, if that would serve his turn, so my master
would yield too; but she cannot abide to hear that the
lord should meddle with it in her lifetime.</p>

<p><i>Inf.</i> Is she then married? why stirs not her husband
in it?</p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> Her husband stirs in it underhand: but because
the other is a great rich man, my master is loath to be
seen in it too much.</p>

of any other; and she bestows this purse of gold on

she has no white money, but there’s gold; or else she

and that works with him.</p>

<p><i>Bell.</i> Where is his cloak and rapier?</p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> He has given up his cloak, and his rapier is
bound to the peace: If you look a little higher, you
may see that another hath entered into hatband for him
too. Six and four have put him into this sweat.</p>

<p><i>Bell.</i> Where’s all his money?</p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> ’Tis put over by exchange; his doublet was going
to be translated, but for me. If any man would ha’ lent
but half a ducat on his beard, the hair of it had stuffed a
pair of breeches by this time; I had but one poor penny,
and that I was glad to niggle out, and buy a holly-wand
to grace him through the street. As hap was, his boots
were on, and them I dustied, to make people think he
had been riding, and I had run by him.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> If any handicraft’s-man was ever suffered to
keep shop in hell, it will be a dice-maker; he’s able to
undo more souls than the devil; I played with mine own
dice, yet lost. Ha’ you any money?</p>

<p><i>Bell.</i> ’Las, I ha’ none.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Must have money, must have some, must have a
cloak, and rapier, and things. Will you go set your lime-twigs,

<p><i>Car.</i> Whither are you ambling, Madam Horseleech?</p>

<p><i>Mis. H.</i> About worldly profit, sir: how do your worships?</p>

<p><i>Bots.</i> We want tools, gentlemen, to furnish the trade:
they wear out day and night, they wear out till no metal
be left in their back. We hear of two or three new
wenches are come up with a carrier, and your old goshawk
here is flying at them.</p>

<p><i>Lod.</i> And, faith, what flesh have you at home?</p>

<p><i>Mis. H.</i> Ordinary dishes; by my troth, sweet men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
there’s few good i’ th’ city; I am as well furnished as any,
and, though I say it, as well customed.</p>

<p><i>Bots.</i> We have meats of all sorts of dressing; we have
stewed meat for your Frenchman, pretty light picking
meat for your Italian, and that which is rotten roasted
for Don Spaniardo.</p>

<p><i>Lod.</i> A pox on’t.</p>

<p><i>Bots.</i> We have poulterer’s ware for your sweet bloods,
as dove, chicken, duck, teal, woodcock, and so forth;
and butcher’s meat for the citizen: yet muttons<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> fall very

<p><i>Mis. H.</i> You’d wear another thing besides the cap.
You’re a wag.</p>

<p><i>Lod.</i> Do’t presently; we’ll ha’ some sport.</p>

<p><i>Mis. H.</i> Wheel you about, sweet men: do you see?
I’ll cheapen wares of the man, whilst Bots is doing with
his wife.</p>

<p><i>Bots.</i> A word, I pray; there is a waiting gentlewoman

<p><i>Bride.</i> One of her aunts? troth, sir, I know her not.</p>

<p><i>Bots.</i> If it please you to bestow the poor labour of
your legs at any time, I will be your convoy thither?</p>

<p><i>Bride.</i> I am a snail, sir, seldom leave my house. If’t
please her to visit me, she shall be welcome.</p>

<p><i>Bots.</i> Do you hear? the naked truth is; my lady hath
a young knight, her son, who loves you, you’re made, if you
lay hold upon’t; this jewel he sends you.      <span class="rightdirection">[<i>Offers jewel.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Lod.</i> What will she do?</p>

<p class="drop-capi6"><span class="smcap">Mat.</span> How am I suited, Front? am I
not gallant, ha?</p>

<p><i>Bell.</i> Yes, sir, you are suited well.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Exceeding passing well, and to
the time.</p>

<p><i>Bell.</i> The tailor has played his part
with you.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> And I have played a gentleman’s part with my
tailor, for I owe him for the making of it.</p>

<p><i>Bell.</i> And why did you so, sir?</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> To keep the fashion; it’s your only fashion now,
of your best rank of gallants, to make their tailors wait
for their money; neither were it wisdom indeed to pay
them upon the first edition of a new suit; for commonly
the suit is owing for, when the linings are worn out, and
there’s no reason, then, that the tailor should be paid
before the mercer.</p>

<p><i>Bell.</i> Is this the suit the knight bestowed upon you?</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> This is the suit, and I need not shame to wear it,
for better men than I would be glad to have suits
bestowed on them. It’s a generous fellow,&mdash;but&mdash;pox on
him&mdash;we whose pericranions are the very limbecks and
stillatories of good wit and fly high, must drive liquor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>

him, he’s an ass, he’s always sober.</p>

<p><i>Bell.</i> This is your fault to wound your friends still.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> No, faith, Front, Lodovico is a noble Slavonian:
it’s more rare to see him in a woman’s company, than for
a Spaniard to go into England, and to challenge the
English fencers there.&mdash;[<i>Knocking within.</i>] One knocks,&mdash;see.&mdash;[<i>Exit</i>

<span class="antiqua">Servants</span>.</i>]&mdash;Oh cry your worship mercy, sir;

<p><i>Mat.</i> A poor gentlewoman, sir.</p>

<p><i>Bell.</i> Yes, and our kingdom, for ’tis our content.</p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> It’s a very poor kingdom then; what, are all your
subjects gone a sheep-shearing? not a maid? not a man?
not so much as a cat? You keep a good house belike,

<p><i>Orl.</i> Well, sir, you talk like a gamester.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> If you come to bark at her, because she’s a poor
rogue, look you, here’s a fine path, sir, and there, there’s
the door.</p>

<p><i>Bell.</i> Matheo?</p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> That’s the devil.</p>

a keg of musty sturgeon, shall stink; where? in your

<p><i>Orl.</i> I know she shall be maintained, but how? she
like a quean, thou like a knave; she like a whore, thou

<p><i>Mat.</i> Thief? Zounds! Thief?</p>

<p><i>Bell.</i> Good, dearest Mat!&mdash;Father!</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Pox on you both! I’ll not be braved. New satin

a pot-hunter, a borrower a beggar&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bell.</i> Dear father&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> An old ass, a dog, a churl, a chuff, an usurer, a

on his back, sir.</p>

<p><i>Bell.</i> Oh me!</p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> Varlet, for this I’ll hang thee.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Ha, ha, alas!</p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> Thou keepest a man of mine here, under my

<p><i>Orl.</i> As arrant a purse-taker as ever cried, Stand! yet
a good fellow I confess, and valiant; but he’ll bring
thee to th’ gallows; you both have robbed of late two
poor country pedlars.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> How’s this? how’s this? dost thou fly high? rob

<p><i>Orl.</i> Ay, knave, two pedlars; hue and cry is up;
warrants are out, and I shall see thee climb a ladder.</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> And come down again as well as a bricklayer or
a tiler. How the vengeance knows he this? If I be
hanged, I’ll tell the people I married old Friscobaldo’s
daughter; I’ll frisco you, and your old carcass.</p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> Tell what you canst; if I stay here longer, I shall
be hanged too, for being in thy company; therefore, as I
found you, I leave you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mat.</i> Kneel, and get money of him.</p>

<p><i>Orl.</i> A knave and a quean, a thief and a strumpet, a

<span class="i0">Harlotta was a dame of so divine<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Did the king’s heart-strings in such love-knots tie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That even the coyest was proud when she could hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men say, “behold, another harlot there!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after her all women that were fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were harlots called as to this day some are:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides, her dalliance she so well does mix,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she’s in Latin called the <i>Meretrix</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus for the name; for the profession, this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who lives in bondage, lives laced; the chief bliss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This world below can yield, is liberty:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who, than whores, with looser wings dare fly?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Juno’s proud bird spreads the fairest tail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So does a strumpet hoist the loftiest sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She’s no man’s slave; men are her slaves; her eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moves not on wheels screwed up with jealousy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, horsed or coached, does merry journeys make,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">More rich being when she’s down, than when she rises.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In brief, gentlemen hunt them, soldiers fight for them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Few men but know them, few or none abhor them:<br /></span>

<p class="drop-capi2"><i><span class="smcap">The</span> Pleasant Comedy of Old Fortunatus</i>
was first published in 1600, having been
produced at Court on the Christmas
before. The play as it stands is an
amplification and a recast of an earlier
play, <i>The First Part of Fortunatus</i>,
which had been performed at Henslowe’s Theatre about four
years previously. This had long been laid aside, when the
idea seems to have occurred to Henslowe to revive it in
fuller form, and Dekker was commissioned to write a second
part, with the result that he recast the whole in one play
instead, adding the episode of the sons of Fortunatus to the
original version. So far, the whole play was taken from the
same source, the old <i>Volksbuch</i> of “Fortunatus,” which, first
published at Augsburg in 1509, was popular in various
languages in the sixteenth century. An interesting account
of this legend and of its connection with the play, is given in
Professor Herford’s “Studies in the Literary Relations of
England and Germany in the Sixteenth Century,” from
which the present note on the play is largely drawn. When
Dekker had completed his recast of the play, it was immediately
ordered for performance at Court, and further scenes,
in this case altogether extraneous to the original story&mdash;those,
namely, in which Virtue and Vice are introduced as
rivals to Fortune&mdash;were added with a special view to this
end. Otherwise the play is pretty faithful to the story, even
in its absurdities. It is worth mention that Hans Sachs had
already dramatized the subject in 1553, which may have had
something to do indirectly with the production of the first
English version.</p>

<p>In the original quarto of 1600, <i>Old Fortunatus</i> is not
divided into acts and scenes, and the division is here

<p><i>2nd O. Man.</i> Even to her temple are my feeble limbs
travelling. Some call her Pandora: some Gloriana, some
Cynthia: some Delphœbe, some Astræa: all by several
names to express several loves: yet all those names make
but one celestial body, as all those loves meet to create but
one soul.</p>

<p><i>1st O. Man.</i> I am one of her own country, and we adore
her by the name of Eliza.</p>

<p><i>2nd O. Man.</i> Blessed name, happy country: your Eliza
makes your land Elysium: but what do you offer?</p>

<p><i>1st O. Man.</i> That which all true subjects should: when
I was young, an armed hand; now I am crooked, an upright
heart: but what offer you?</p>

<p><i>2nd O. Man.</i> That which all strangers do: two eyes
struck blind with admiration: two lips proud to sound her
glory: two hands held up full of prayers and praises: what
not, that may express love? what not, that may make her
beloved?</p>

<p><i>1st O. Man.</i> How long is’t since you last beheld her?</p>

<p><i>2nd O. Man.</i> A just year: yet that year hath seemed to
me but one day, because her glory hath been my hourly
contemplation, and yet that year hath seemed to me more
than twice seven years, because so long I have been absent
from her. Come therefore, good father, let’s go faster, lest
we come too late: for see, the tapers of the night are already
lighted, and stand brightly burning in their starry candle-sticks:
see how gloriously the moon shines upon us.      <span class="rightdirection">[<i>Both kneel.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Fort.</i> Ay, this wood, and which is my best way out.</p>

<p><i>Echo.</i> Best way out.</p>

<p><i>Fort.</i> Ha, ha, ha, that’s true, my best way out is my
best way out, but how that out will come in, by this
maggot I know not. I see by this we are all worms’
meat. Well, I am very poor and very patient; Patience
is a virtue: would I were not virtuous, that’s to say, not
poor, but full of vice, that’s to say, full of chinks. Ha,
ha, so I am, for I am so full of chinks, that a horse with
one eye may look through and through me. I have
sighed long, and that makes me windy; I have fasted
long, and that makes me chaste; marry, I have prayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
little, and that makes me I still dance in this conjuring
circle; I have wandered long, and that makes me weary.
But for my weariness, anon I’ll lie down, instead of fasting
I’ll feed upon nuts, and instead of sighing will laugh
and be lean, Sirrah Echo.</p>

<p><i>Echo.</i> Sirrah Echo.</p>

<p><i>Echo.</i> Ha, ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p><i>Fort.</i> Why so, two fools laugh at one another, I at
my tittle tattle gammer Echo, and she at me. Shortly
there will creep out in print some filthy book of the old
hoary wandering knight, meaning me: would I were that
book, for then I should be sure to creep out from hence.
I should be a good soldier, for I traverse my ground
rarely; marry I see neither enemy nor friends, but
popinjays, and squirrels, and apes, and owls, and daws,
and wagtails, and the spite is that none of these grass-eaters
can speak my language, but this fool that mocks
me, and swears to have the last word, in spite of my
teeth, ay, and she shall have it because she is a woman,
which kind of cattle are indeed all echo, nothing but
tongue, and are like the great bell of St. Michael’s<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> in
Cyprus, that keeps most rumbling when men would most
sleep. Echo, a pox on thee for mocking me.</p>

<p><i>Echo.</i> A pox on thee for mocking me.</p>

<p><i>Fort.</i> Why so, Snip snap, this war is at an end, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
this wilderness is world without end. To see how travel
can transform: my teeth are turned into nutcrackers, a
thousand to one I break out shortly, for I am full of
nothing but waxen kernels, my tongue speaks no
language but an almond for a parrot, and crack me this
nut. If I hop three days more up and down this cage of
cuckoos’ nests, I shall turn wild man sure, and be hired
to throw squibs among the commonalty upon some terrible
day. In the meantime, to tell truth, here will I lie.
Farewell, fool!</p>

<p><i>Echo.</i> Farewell, fool.</p>

<p><i>Fort.</i> Are not these comfortable words to a wise man?
All hail, signor tree, by your leave I’ll sleep under your
leaves. I pray bow to me, and I’ll bend to you, for your
back and my brows must, I doubt, have a game or two
at noddy ere I wake again: down, great heart, down.

<p><i>Fort.</i> But now go dwell with cares and quickly die?
How quickly? if I die to-morrow, I’ll be merry to-day:
if next day, I’ll be merry to-morrow. Go dwell with cares?
Where dwells Care? Hum ha, in what house dwells
Care, that I may choose an honester neighbour? In
princes’ courts? No. Among fair ladies? Neither:
there’s no care dwells with them, but care how to be most
gallant. Among gallants then? Fie, fie, no! Care is
afraid sure of a gilt rapier, the scent of musk is her prison,
tobacco chokes her, rich attire presseth her to death.
Princes, fair ladies and gallants, have amongst you then,
for this wet-eyed wench Care dwells with wretches: they
are wretches that feel want, I shall feel none if I be never
poor; therefore, Care, I cashier you my company. I
wonder what blind gossip this minx is that is so prodigal;
she should be a good one by her open dealing: her
name’s Fortune: it’s no matter what she is, so she does
as she says. “Thou shalt spend ever, and be never
poor.” Mass, yet I feel nothing here to make me rich:&mdash;here’s
no sweet music with her silver sound. Try deeper:
ho God be here: ha, ha, one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine and ten, good, just ten. It’s gold sure,
it’s so heavy, try again, one, two, &amp;c. Good again, just
ten, and just ten. Ha, ha, ha, this is rare: a leather
mint, admirable: an Indian mine in a lamb’s skin,
miraculous! I’ll fill three or four bags full for my sons,
but keep this for myself. If that lean tawny face tobacconist
Death, that turns all into smoke, must turn me so
quickly into ashes, yet I will not mourn in ashes, but in
music, hey, old lad, be merry. Here’s riches, wisdom,
strength, health, beauty, and long life (if I die not

man made out of wax, for these satin commodities have
such smooth consciences that they’ll have no man give
his word for them or stand bound for their coming forth,

Monsieur Money bail them. Shadow, I am out of my
little wits to see this.</p>

fat gluttons feed all day long, whilst I that am lean fast
every day: I am out of my wits, to see our Famagosta
fools turn half a shop of wares into a suit of gay apparel,
only to make other idiots laugh, and wise men to cry,
who’s the fool now? I am mad, to see soldiers beg, and
cowards brave: I am mad, to see scholars in the broker’s
shop, and dunces in the mercer’s: I am mad, to see men

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>Outside the House of</i> <span class="smcap">Fortunatus</span>.</h4>

<p class="indentdirection"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Andelocia</span>, <i>very gallant,<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> and</i> <span class="smcap">Shadow</span>.</p>


<p><i>Andel.</i> Shadow? what have I lost to-day at dice?</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> More than you will win again in a month.</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> Why, sir, how much comes it to?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> It comes to nothing, sir, for you have lost your
wits; and when a man’s wits are lost, the man is like
twenty pounds’ worth of tobacco, which mounts into th’
air, and proves nothing but one thing.</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> And what thing is that, you ass?</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> Marry, sir, that he is an ass that melts so much
money in smoke.</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> ’Twere a charitable deed to hang thee a
smoking.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> I should never make good bacon, because I am
not fat.</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> I’ll be sworn thy wit is lean.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> It’s happy I have a lean wit: but, master, you
have none; for when your money tripped away, that
went after it, and ever since you have been mad. Here
comes your brother.</p>

<p class="indentdirection"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Ampedo</span>.</p>


<p>Borrow a dram of him, if his be not mouldy: for
men’s wits in these days are like the cuckoo, bald once
a year, and that makes motley so dear, and fools so good
cheap.</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> Brother, all hail.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> There’s a rattling salutation.</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> You must lend me some more money. Nay,
never look so strange, an you will come off, so; if you
will bar me from square play, do. Come, come, when
the old traveller my father comes home, like a young
ape, full of fantastic tricks, or a painted parrot stuck full
of outlandish feathers, he’ll lead the world in a string, and
then like a hot shot I’ll charge and discharge all.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> I would be loth, master, to see that day: for he
leads the world in a string that goes to hanging.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Andel.</i> Take heed I turn not that head into the world, and lead you so.<br /></span>

<p><i>Andel.</i> Thanks for my crowns.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> Shadow, I am
villainous hungry, to hear one of the seven wise masters
talk thus emptily.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> I am a villain, master, if I am not hungry.</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> Because I’ll save this gold, sirrah Shadow, we’ll
feed ourselves with paradoxes.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> Oh rare: what meat’s that?</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> Meat, you gull: ’tis no meat: a dish of
paradoxes is a feast of strange opinion, ’tis an ordinary
that our greatest gallants haunt nowadays, because they
would be held for statesmen.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> I shall never fill my belly with opinions.</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> In despite of sway-bellies, gluttons, and sweet
mouthed epicures, I’ll have thee maintain a paradox in
commendations of hunger.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> I shall never have the stomach to do’t.</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> See’st thou this crusado?<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> do it, and turn this
into a feast.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> Covetousness and lechery are two devils, they’ll
tempt a man to wade through deep matters: I’ll do’t
though good cheer conspire my death, for speaking treason
against her.</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> Fall to it then with a full mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Shad.</i> Oh famine, inspire me with thy miserable reasons.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I begin, master.<br /></span>
</div>

<p><i>Amp.</i> O miserable invocation.</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> Silence!</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> There’s no man but loves one of these three
beasts, a horse, a hound, or a whore; the horse by his
goodwill has his head ever in the manger; the whore
with your ill will has her hand ever in your purse; and a
hungry dog eats dirty puddings.</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> This is profound, forward: the conclusion of
this now.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> The conclusion is plain: for since all men love
one of these three monsters, being such terrible eaters,
therefore all men love hunger.</p>

<p><i>Amp.</i> A very lean argument.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> I can make it no fatter.</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> Proceed, good Shadow; this fats me.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> Hunger is made of gunpowder.</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> Give fire to that opinion.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> Stand by, lest it blow you up. Hunger is made
of gunpowder, or gunpowder of hunger, for they both eat
through stone walls; hunger is a grindstone, it sharpens
wit; hunger is fuller of love than Cupid, for it makes a
man eat himself; hunger was the first that ever opened a
cook shop, cooks the first that ever made sauce, sauce
being liquorish, licks up good meat; good meat preserves
life: hunger therefore preserves life.</p>

<p><i>Amp.</i> By my consent thou shouldst still live by hunger.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> Not so, hunger makes no man mortal: hunger
is an excellent physician, for he dares kill any body.
Hunger is one of the seven liberal sciences.</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> Oh learned! Which of the seven?</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> Music, for she’ll make a man leap at a crust;
but as few care for her six sisters, so none love to dance
after her pipe. Hunger, master, is hungry and covetous;
therefore the crusado.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> But hast thou no sharper reasons than this?</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> Yes, one: the dagger of Cyprus had never
stabbed out such six penny pipes, but for hunger.</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> Why, you dolt, these pipes<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> are but in their
minority.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> My belly and my purse have been twenty
times at dagger’s drawing, with parting the little urchins.</p>

<p class="indentdirection"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Fortunatus</span>.</p>


<p><i>Amp.</i> Peace, idiot, peace, my father is returned.</p>

<p><i>Fort.</i> Touch me not, boys, I am nothing but air; let
none speak to me, till you have marked me well.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> (<i>Chalking</i> <span class="smcap">Fortunatus’</span> <i>back</i>.) Now speak your
mind.</p>

<p><i>Amp.</i> Villain, why hast thou chalked my father’s back?</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> Only to mark him, and to try what colour air is of.</p>

<p><i>Fort.</i> Regard him not, Ampedo: Andelocia, Shadow,
view me, am I as you are, or am I transformed?</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> I thought travel would turn my father madman
or fool.</p>

<p><i>Amp.</i> How should you be transformed? I see no
change.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> If your wits be not planet stricken, if your brains
lie in their right place, you are well enough; for your
body is little mended by your fetching vagaries.</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> Methinks, father, you look as you did, only
your face is more withered.</p>

<p><i>Fort.</i> That’s not my fault; age is like love, it cannot
be hid.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> Or like gunpowder a-fire, or like a fool, or like
a young novice new come to his lands: for all these will
show of what house they come. Now, sir, you may
amplify.</p>

<p><i>Fort.</i> Shadow, turn thy tongue to a shadow, be silent!
Boys, be proud, your father hath the whole world in this
compass, I am all felicity, up to the brims. In a minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>

Famagosta.</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> How? in a minute, father? Ha, ha, I see
travellers must lie.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> ’Tis their destiny: the Fates do so conspire.</p>

<p><i>Fort.</i> I have cut through the air like a falcon; I would
have it seem strange to you.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> So it does, sir.</p>

<p><i>Fort.</i> But ’tis true: I would not have you believe it
neither.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> No more we do not, sir.</p>

<p><i>Fort.</i> But ’tis miraculous and true. Desire to see you,
brought me to Cyprus. I’ll leave you more gold, and go
visit more countries.</p>

<p><i>Cypr.</i> By this then it seems a thing impossible, to
know when an English lady loves truly.</p>

<p><i>Agrip.</i> Not so, for when her soul steals into her heart,
and her heart leaps up to her eyes, and her eyes drop into
her hands, then if she say, Here’s my hand! she’s your
own,&mdash;else never.</p>

<p><i>Cyp.</i> Here’s a pair of your prisoners, let’s try their
opinion.</p>

<p><i>Agrip.</i> My kind prisoners, well encountered; the
Prince of Cyprus here and myself have been wrangling
about a question of love: my lord of Orleans, you look
lean, and likest a lover&mdash;Whether is it more torment to
love a lady and never enjoy her, or always to enjoy a
lady whom you cannot choose but hate?</p>

<p><i>Orle.</i> To hold her ever in mine arms whom I loath in
my heart, were some plague, yet the punishment were no
more than to be enjoined to keep poison in my hand,
yet never to taste it.</p>

<p><i>Agrip.</i> But say you should be compelled to swallow
the poison?</p>

<p><i>Orle.</i> Then a speedy death would end a speeding
misery. But to love a lady and never enjoy her, oh it is
not death, but worse than damnation; ’tis hell, ’tis&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Agrip.</i> No more, no more, good Orleans; nay then, I
see my prisoner is in love too.</p>

<p><i>Cypr.</i> Methinks, soldiers cannot fall into the fashion
of love.</p>

<p><i>Agrip.</i> Methinks a soldier is the most faithful lover of
all men else; for his affection stands not upon compliment.
His wooing is plain home-spun stuff; there’s no
outlandish thread in it, no rhetoric. A soldier casts no
figures to get his mistress’ heart; his love is like his valour
in the field, when he pays downright blows.</p>

<p><i>Gall.</i> True, madam, but would you receive such payment?</p>

<p><i>Agrip.</i> No, but I mean, I love a soldier best for his
plain dealing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cypr.</i> That’s as good as the first.</p>

<p><i>Agrip.</i> Be it so, that goodness I like: for what lady
can abide to love a spruce silken-face courtier, that stands
every morning two or three hours learning how to look
by his glass, how to speak by his glass, how to sigh by
his glass, how to court his mistress by his glass? I would
wish him no other plague, but to have a mistress as brittle
as glass.</p>

<p><i>Gall.</i> And that were as bad as the horn plague.</p>

<p><i>Cypr.</i> Are any lovers possessed with this madness?</p>

<p><i>Agrip.</i> What madmen are not possessed with this love?
Yet by my troth, we poor women do but smile in our
sleeves to see all this foppery: yet we all desire to see
our lovers attired gallantly, to hear them sing sweetly, to
behold them dance comely and such like. But this apish
monkey fashion of effeminate niceness, out upon it! Oh,
I hate it worse than to be counted a scold.</p>

<p><i>Cypr.</i> Indeed, men are most regarded, when they least
regard themselves.</p>

<p><i>Gall.</i> And women most honoured, when they show
most mercy to their lovers.</p>

<p><i>Orle.</i> But is’t not a miserable tyranny, to see a lady
triumph in the passions of a soul languishing through her
cruelty?</p>

<p><i>Cypr.</i> Methinks it is.</p>

<p><i>Gall.</i> Methinks ’tis more than tyranny.</p>

<p><i>Agrip.</i> So think not I; for as there is no reason to
hate any that love us, so it were madness to love all that
do not hate us; women are created beautiful, only because
men should woo them; for ’twere miserable tyranny to
enjoin poor women to woo men: I would not hear of a
woman in love, for my father’s kingdom.</p>

<p><i>Cypr.</i> I never heard of any woman that hated love.</p>

<p><i>Agrip.</i> Nor I: but we had all rather die than confess
we love; our glory is to hear men sigh whilst we smile,
to kill them with a frown, to strike them dead with a
sharp eye, to make you this day wear a feather, and to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
a sick nightcap. Oh, why this is rare, there’s
a certain deity in this, when a lady by the magic of her
looks, can turn a man into twenty shapes.</p>

<p><i>Orle.</i> Sweet friend, she speaks this but to torture me.</p>

<p><i>Gall.</i> I’ll teach thee how to plague her: love her not.</p>

<p><i>Agrip.</i> Poor Orleans, how lamentably he looks: if he
stay, he’ll make me surely love him for pure pity. I must
send him hence, for of all sorts of love, I hate the French;
I pray thee, sweet prisoner, entreat Lord Longaville to
come to me presently.</p>

<p><i>Orle.</i> I will, and esteem myself more than happy, that
you will employ me.      <span class="rightdirection">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Agrip.</i> Watch him, watch him for God’s sake, if he
sigh not or look not back.</p>

<p><i>Cypr.</i> He does both: but what mystery lies in this?</p>

<p><i>Agrip.</i> Nay, no mystery, ’tis as plain as Cupid’s forehead:
why this is as it should be.&mdash;“And esteem myself
more than happy, that you will employ me.” My French
prisoner is in love over head and ears.</p>

<p><i>Cypr.</i> It’s wonder how he ’scapes drowning.</p>

<p><i>Gall.</i> With whom, think you?</p>

<p><i>Agrip.</i> With his keeper, for a good wager: Ah, how
glad is he to obey! And how proud am I to command
in this empire of affection! Over him and such spongy-livered
youths, that lie soaking in love, I triumph more
with mine eye, than ever he did over a soldier with his
sword. Is’t not a gallant victory for me to subdue my
father’s enemy with a look? Prince of Cyprus, you were
best take heed, how you encounter an English lady.</p>

<p><i>Cypr.</i> God bless me from loving any of you, if all be
so cruel.</p>

<p><i>Agrip.</i> God bless me from suffering you to love me, if
you be not so formable.</p>

<p><i>Cypr.</i> Will you command me any service, as you have
done Orleans?</p>

<p><i>Agrip.</i> No other service but this, that, as Orleans, you
love me, for no other reason, but that I may torment you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cypr.</i> I will: conditionally, that in all company I
may call you my tormentor.</p>

<p><i>Agrip.</i> You shall: conditionally, that you never beg
for mercy. Come, my Lord of Galloway.</p>

<span><span class="smcap">Agrip.</span> What devil art thou that affright’st me thus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haling a princess from her father’s court,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To spoil her in this savage wilderness?<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="prose"><i>Andel.</i> Indeed the devil and the pick-purse
should always fly together, for
they are sworn brothers: but Madam Covetousness, I
am neither a devil as you call me, nor a jeweller as I
call myself; no, nor a juggler,&mdash;yet ere you and I part, we’ll
have some legerdemain together. Do you know me?</p>

<span class="i0"><i>Agrip.</i> I am betrayed: this is the Cypriot.<br /></span>

<p><i>Andel.</i> Talk not you of satisfaction, this is some recompense,

it off, and I’ll mince it as small as pie meat. The purse?
hang the purse: were that gone, I can make another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
and another, and another, ay, and another: ’tis not the
purse I care for, but the purser, you, ay you. Is’t not
a shame that a king’s daughter, a fair lady, a lady not for
lords, but for monarchs, should for gold sell her love,
and when she has her own asking, and that there stands
nothing between, then to cheat your sweetheart? O fie,
fie, a she cony-catcher? You must be dealt fondly with.</p>

heart at rest, for I have set up my rest, that except you
can run swifter than a hart, home you go not. What
pains shall I lay upon you? Let me see: I could serve
you now but a slippery touch: I could get a young king
or two, or three, of you, and then send you home, and bid
their grandsire king nurse them: I could pepper you, but
I will not.</p>

nor curse me not. If you think but a crabbed thought of
me, the spirit that carried you in mine arms through the
air, will tell me all; therefore set your Sunday face upon’t.
Since you’ll love me, I’ll love you, I’ll marry you, and lie

not. England, you’ll say, is yours: but, Agripyne, love

<span class="i0"><i>Agrip.</i> O gentle Andelocia, pity me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take off this infamy, or take my life.<br /></span>
</div>

<p><i>Andel.</i> Your life? you think then that I am a true
doctor indeed, that tie up my living in the knots of winding
sheets: your life? no, keep your life, but deliver your
purse: you know the thief’s salutation,&mdash;“Stand and
deliver.” So, this is mine, and these yours: I’ll teach you
to live by the sweat of other men’s brows.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> And to strive to be fairer than God made her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> Right, Shadow: therefore vanish, you have
made me turn juggler, and cry “hey-pass,” but your horns
shall not repass.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p><i>Agrip.</i> O gentle Andelocia.</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> Andelocia is a nettle: if you touch him gently,
he’ll sting you.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> Or a rose: if you pull his sweet stalk he’ll prick
you.</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> Therefore not a word; go, trudge to your
father. Sigh not for your purse, money may be got by
you, as well as by the little Welshwoman in Cyprus, that
had but one horn in her head;<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> you have two, and perhaps
you shall cast both. As you use me, mark those
words well, “as you use me,” nay, y’are best fly, I’ll not
endure one word more. Yet stay too, because you
entreat me so gently, and that I’ll make some amends to
your father,&mdash;although I care not for any king in Christendom,
yet hold you, take this apple, eat it as you go to
court, and your horns shall play the cowards and fall
from you.</p>

<p><i>Agrip.</i> O gentle Andelocia.</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> Nay, away, not a word.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> Ha, ha, ha! ’Ware horns!      <span class="rightdirection">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Agripyne</span>, <i>weeping</i>.</span></p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> Why dost thou laugh, Shadow?</p>

and pride.</p>

<p><i>Amp.</i> Brother, what mysteries lie in all this?</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> Tricks, Ampedo, tricks, devices, and mad
hieroglyphics, mirth, mirth, and melody. O, there’s more
music in this, than all the gamut airs, and sol fa res, in
the world; here’s the purse, and here’s the hat: because
you shall be sure I’ll not start, wear you this, you know
its virtue. If danger beset you, fly and away: a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
broken-shinned limping-legged jades run hobbling to
seek us. Shadow, we’ll for all this have one fit of mirth
more, to make us laugh and be fat.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> And when we are fat, master, we’ll do as all
gluttons do, laugh and lie down.</p>

<p><i>Andel.</i> Hie thee to my chamber, make ready my
richest attire, I’ll to court presently.</p>

<p><i>Shad.</i> I’ll go to court in this attire, for apparel is but
the shadow of a man, but shadow is the substance of his
apparel.      <span class="rightdirection">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Shadow</span>.</span></p>

court them, and hands to feel them? Out, you stock, you
stone, you log’s end: Are not legs made to dance, and
shall mine limp up and down the world after your cloth-stocking-heels?
You have the hat, keep it. Anon I’ll
visit your virtuous countenance again; adieu! Pleasure
is my sweet mistress, I wear her love in my hat, and her

<span class="smcap">The</span> Witch of Edmonton, which
was probably first performed in 1623,
was not published until thirty-five years
later, in 1658. It was then issued in the
usual quarto form, with the title: <i>The
Witch of Edmonton</i>: “A known True
Story. Composed into a Tragi-Comedy
by divers well-esteemed Poets, William Rowley, Thomas
Dekker, John Ford, &amp;c. Acted by the Prince’s Servants,
often at the Cock-Pit in Drury-Lane, once at Court, with
singular Applause.” The best modern reprint of the play is
that in the Gifford-Dyce edition of Ford, upon which the
present version is based.</p>

<p>It is impossible to assign the exact share of the various
authors in the play. The business of the Witch, the rustic
chorus, and certain other parts mark themselves out as
mainly Dekker’s. The conception of Sir Arthur Clarington,
and the subsidiary domestic plot is no doubt mainly Ford’s.
Rowley’s share is more difficult to ascertain. The intimate
collaboration of all three can alone be held accountable for
some of the scenes, and indeed in even the passages most
characteristic of any one of the authors, the touch of another
often shows itself in a chance word or phrase.</p>

<p>The justification for the description of the play as “A
known true story” is a pamphlet written by Henry Goodcole,
and published at London in 1621, giving an account
of one Elizabeth Sawyer, late of Islington, who was “executed
in 1621 for witchcraft.” See Caulfield’s “Portraits,
Memoirs, and Characters of Remarkable Persons,” 1794.
No existing copy of the pamphlet is known, but the British
Museum possesses copies of two of Goodcole’s other pamphlets
on similar subjects.</p>

<h4>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>Edmonton. A Room in</i> <span class="smcap">Carter’s</span> <i>House</i>.</h4>

<p class="indentdirection"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Old Thorney</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Carter</span>.</p>


<p><i>O. Thor.</i> You offer, Master Carter, like a gentleman;
I cannot find fault with it, ’tis so fair.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> No gentleman I, Master Thorney; spare the
Mastership, call me by my name, John Carter. Master
is a title my father, nor his before him, were acquainted
with; honest Hertfordshire yeomen; such an
one am I; my word and my deed shall be proved one at
all times. I mean to give you no security for the marriage
money.</p>

<p><i>O. Thor.</i> How! no security? although it need not so
long as you live, yet who is he has surety of his life one
hour? Men, the proverb says, are mortal; else, for my
part, I distrust you not, were the sum double.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Double, treble, more or less, I tell you, Master
Thorney, I’ll give no security. Bonds and bills are but
terriers to catch fools, and keep lazy knaves busy; my
security shall be present payment. And we here about
Edmonton hold present payment as sure as an alderman’s
bond in London, Master Thorney.</p>

<p><i>O. Thor.</i> I cry you mercy, sir; I understood you not.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> I like young Frank well, so does my Susan too;
the girl has a fancy to him, which makes me ready in my
purse. There be other suitors within, that make much
noise to little purpose. If Frank love Sue, Sue shall have
none but Frank. ’Tis a mannerly girl, Master Thorney,
though but a homely man’s daughter; there have worse
faces looked out of black bags, man.</p>

<p><i>O. Thor.</i> You speak your mind freely and honestly. I
marvel my son comes not; I am sure he will be here
some time to-day.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> To-day or to-morrow, when he comes he shall be
welcome to bread, beer, and beef, yeoman’s fare; we have
no kickshaws: full dishes, whole bellyfuls. Should I diet
three days at one of the slender city-suppers, you might
send me to Barber-Surgeons’ hall the fourth day, to hang
up for an anatomy.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>&mdash;Here come they that&mdash;</p>

<span class="smcap">Katherine</span>.</p>


<p>How now, girls! every day play-day with you? Valentine’s
day too, all by couples? Thus will young folks do
when we are laid in our graves, Master Thorney; here’s
all the care they take. And how do you find the wenches,
gentlemen? have they any mind to a loose gown and a
strait shoe? Win ’em and wear ’em; they shall choose
for themselves by my consent.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Warbeck and Sue are at it still. I laugh to myself,
Master Thorney, to see how earnestly he beats the
bush, while the bird is flown into another’s bosom. A very
unthrift, Master Thorney; one of the country roaring-lads:
we have such as well as the city, and as arrant
rake-hells as they are, though not so nimble at their
prizes of wit. Sue knows the rascal to an hair’s-breadth,
and will fit him accordingly.</p>

<p><i>O. Thor.</i> What is the other gentleman?</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> One Somerton; the honester man of the two by
five pound in every stone-weight. A civil fellow; he has
a fine convenient estate of land in West Ham, by Essex:
Master Ranges, that dwells by Enfield, sent him hither.
He likes Kate well; I may tell you I think she likes
him as well: if they agree, I’ll not hinder the match
for my part. But that Warbeck is such another&mdash;I
use him kindly for Master Somerton’s sake; for he
came hither first as a companion of his: honest men,
Master Thorney, may fall into knaves’ company now and

<p class="indentdirection"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Carter</span>, <span class="smcap">Warbeck</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Somerton</span>.</p>


<p><i>Car.</i> How now, gentlemen! cloudy? I know, Master
Warbeck, you are in a fog about my daughter’s marriage.</p>

<p><i>War.</i> And can you blame me, sir?</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Nor you me justly. Wedding and hanging are
tied up both in a proverb; and destiny is the juggler that
unties the knot. My hope is, you are reserved to a richer
fortune than my poor daughter.</p>

<p><i>War.</i> However, your promise&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Is a kind of debt, I confess it.</p>

<p><i>War.</i> Which honest men should pay.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Yet some gentlemen break in that point now and
then, by your leave, sir.</p>

<p><i>Som.</i> I confess thou hast had a little wrong in the
wench; but patience is the only salve to cure it. Since
Thorney has won the wench, he has most reason to wear
her.</p>

<p><i>War.</i> Love in this kind admits no reason to wear her.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Then Love’s a fool, and what wise man will take
exception?</p>

<p><i>Som.</i> Come, frolic, Ned: were every man master of
his own fortune, Fate might pick straws, and Destiny go
a-wool-gathering.</p>

<p><i>War.</i> You hold yours in a string, though: ’tis well;
but if there be any equity, look thou to meet the like
usage ere long.</p>

<p><i>Som.</i> In my love to her sister Katherine? Indeed,
they are a pair of arrows drawn out of one quiver, and
should fly at an even length; if she do run after her
sister.&mdash;</p>

<p><i>War.</i> Look for the same mercy at my hands as I have
received at thine.</p>

<p><i>Som.</i> She’ll keep a surer compass; I have too strong a
confidence to mistrust her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span></p>

<p><i>War.</i> And that confidence is a wind that has blown
many a married man ashore at Cuckold’s Haven, I can
tell you; I wish yours more prosperous though.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> Whate’er your wish, I’ll master my promise to
him.</p>

<p><i>War.</i> Yes, as you did to me.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> No more of that, if you love me: but for the
more assurance, the next offered occasion shall consummate
the marriage; and that once sealed&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Som.</i> Leave the manage of the rest to my care. But
see, the bridegroom and bride come; the new pair of
Sheffield knives, fitted both to one sheath.</p>

<p><i>War.</i> The sheath might have been better fitted, if
somebody had their due; but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> No harsh language, if thou lovest me. Frank
Thorney has done&mdash;</p>

<p><i>War.</i> No more than I, or thou, or any man, things so
standing, would have attempted.</p>

<p class="drop-capi2">
<span class="smcap">First Clown.</span> Nay, Cuddy, prithee
do not leave us now; if we part all
this night, we shall not meet before
day.</p>

<p><i>2nd Cl.</i> I prithee, Banks, let’s keep
together now.</p>

<p><i>Cud.</i> If you were wise, a word would
serve; but as you are, I must be forced to tell you
again, I have a little private business, an hour’s work;
it may prove but an half hour’s, as luck may serve; and
then I take horse, and along with you. Have we
e’er a witch in the morris?</p>

<p><i>1st Cl.</i> No, no; no woman’s part but Maid Marian
and the Hobby-horse.</p>

<p><i>Cud.</i> I’ll have a witch; I love a witch.</p>

<p><i>1st Cl.</i> ’Faith, witches themselves are so common now-a-days,
that the counterfeit will not be regarded. They
say we have three or four in Edmonton besides Mother
Sawyer.</p>

<p><i>2nd Cl.</i> I would she would dance her part with us.</p>

<p><i>3rd Cl.</i> So would not I; for if she comes, the devil
and all comes along with her.</p>

<p><i>Cud.</i> Well, I’ll have a witch; I have loved a witch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
ever since I played at cherry-pit.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> Leave me, and get
my horse dressed; give him oats: but water him not till
I come. Whither do we foot it first?</p>

<p><i>2nd Cl.</i> To Sir Arthur Clarington’s first; then whither
thou wilt.</p>

<p><i>Cud.</i> Well, I am content; but we must up to Carter’s,
the rich yeoman; I must be seen on hobby-horse there.</p>

<p><i>1st Cl.</i> O, I smell him now!&mdash;I’ll lay my ears Banks is
in love, and that’s the reason he would walk melancholy
by himself.</p>

<p><i>Cud.</i> Ha! who was that said I was in love?</p>

<p><i>1st Cl.</i> Not I.</p>

<p><i>2nd Cl.</i> Nor I.</p>

<p><i>Cud.</i> Go to, no more of that: when I understand what
you speak, I know what you say; believe that.</p>

<p><i>1st Cl.</i> Well, ’twas I, I’ll not deny it; I meant no hurt
in’t. I have seen you walk up to Carter’s of Chessum:
Banks, were not you there last Shrovetide?</p>

<p><i>Cud.</i> Yes, I was ten days together there the last
Shrovetide.</p>

<p><i>2nd Cl.</i> How could that be, when there are but seven
days in the week?</p>

<p><i>Cud.</i> Prithee peace! I reckon <i>stila nova</i> as a traveller;
thou understandest as a fresh-water farmer, that never
sawest a week beyond sea. Ask any soldier that ever
received his pay but in the Low Countries, and he’ll tell
thee there are eight days in the week<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> there hard by.
How dost thou think they rise in High Germany, Italy,
and those remoter places?</p>

<p><i>3rd Cl.</i> Ay, but simply there are but seven days in the
week yet.</p>

<p><i>Cud.</i> No, simply as thou understandest. Prithee look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
but in the lover’s almanac: when he has been but three
days absent, “O,” says he, “I have not seen my love
these seven years:” there’s a long cut! When he comes
to her again and embraces her, “O,” says he, “now methinks
I am in Heaven;” and that’s a pretty step! He
that can get up to Heaven in ten days need not repent
his journey; you may ride a hundred days in a caroche,<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>
and be further off than when you set forth. But, I pray
you, good morris-mates, now leave me. I will be with
you by midnight.</p>

<p><i>1st Cl.</i> Well, since he will be alone, we’ll back again
and trouble him no more.</p>

<p><i>All the Clowns.</i> But remember, Banks.</p>

<p><i>Cud.</i> The hobby-horse shall be remembered. But
hark you; get Poldavis, the barber’s boy, for the witch,
because he can show his art better than another.      <span class="rightdirection">[<i>Exeunt all but</i> <span class="smcap">Cuddy</span>.</span></p>

<p>Well, now to my walk. I am near the place where I
should meet&mdash;I know not what: say I meet a thief? I
must follow him, if to the gallows; say I meet a horse,
or hare, or hound? still I must follow: some slow-paced
beast, I hope; yet love is full of lightness in the heaviest
lovers. Ha! my guide is come.</p>

<p><i>Dog.</i> Yes, I can speak.</p>

dog that catched at the shadow in the water. Pray you,
let me catechise you a little; what might one call your
name, dog?</p>

<p><i>Dog.</i> My dame calls me Tom.</p>

<p><i>Cud.</i> ’Tis well, and she may call me Ass; so there’s
an whole one betwixt us, Tom-Ass: she said I should

beloved; cherish me, and I’ll do anything for thee.</p>

<p><i>Cud.</i> Well, you shall have jowls and livers; I have
butchers to my friends that shall bestow ’em: and I
will keep crusts and bones for you, if you’ll be a kind
dog, Tom.</p>

<p><i>Dog.</i> Any thing; I’ll help thee to thy love.</p>

<p><i>Cud.</i> Wilt thou? that promise shall cost me a brown

would mingle amongst our morris-dancers in the morning.
You can dance?</p>

<p><i>Dog.</i> Yes, yes, any thing; I’ll be there, but unseen to

ship her to Newgate; here’s enough, if all her other

have a spirit, they say, comes to you in the likeness of a

him?</p>

again I thank thee, Tom, for all this counsel; without a
fee too! there’s few lawyers of thy mind now. Certainly,
Tom, I begin to pity thee.</p>

<p><i>Dog.</i> Pity me! for what?</p>

<p><i>Cud.</i> Were it not possible for thee to become an
honest dog yet?&mdash;’Tis a base life that you lead, Tom, to
serve witches, to kill innocent children, to kill harmless
cattle, to stroy<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> corn and fruit, etc.: ’twere better yet to
be a butcher and kill for yourself.</p>

<p><i>Dog.</i> Why, these are all my delights, my pleasures, fool.</p>

<p><i>Cud.</i> Or, Tom, if you could give your mind to ducking,&mdash;I
know you can swim, fetch, and carry,&mdash;some shop-keeper
in London would take great delight in you, and
be a tender master over you: or if you have a mind to
the game either at bull or bear, I think I could prefer you
to Moll Cutpurse<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dog.</i> Ha, ha! I should kill all the game,&mdash;bulls, bears,
dogs and all; not a cub to be left.</p>

<p><i>Cud.</i> You could do, Tom; but you must play fair;
you should be staved-off else. Or if your stomach did
better like to serve in some nobleman’s, knight’s, or
gentleman’s kitchen, if you could brook the wheel and
turn the spit&mdash;your labour could not be much&mdash;when
they have roast meat, that’s but once or twice in the week
at most: here you might lick your own toes very well.
Or if you could translate yourself into a lady’s arming
puppy, there you might lick sweet lips, and do many
pretty offices; but to creep under an old witch’s coats,
and suck like a great puppy! fie upon’t!&mdash;I have heard
beastly things of you, Tom.</p>
